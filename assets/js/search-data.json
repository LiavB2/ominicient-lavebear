Unit 3 Section 8.1 - Taiyo Iwazaki . Lesson Objectives: . Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 8): print(&quot;Hi, my name is Liav!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i==6): print(&quot;Your name isn&#39;t Liav Anymore&quot;) break . Hi, my name is Liav! Hi, my name is Liav! Hi, my name is Liav! Hi, my name is Liav! Hi, my name is Liav! Hi, my name is Liav! Your name isn&#39;t Liav Anymore . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(10-i) . 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Cell In [4], line 1 for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . number = 0 while number &lt; 82: if number == 3 or number == 16 or number == 29 or number == 42 or number == 55 or number == 68 or number == 81: print(number) number += 1 . 3 16 29 42 55 68 81 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

This will include: Personalizing menus/removing it entirely | Changing the color scheme so that my SASS and CSS code will not match someone elses or another github theme | . | . Apply Credit . I will need to update my README.md so that I give credit to Mr. Mort and the nighthawkcodingsociety so that I am not flagged for violating the licensing policies that mort instated. | I will probably end up making a new readme.md from scratch | . Wipe Unceccesary Code . Finally, I will have to remove all the files and code that do not contribute to my feature and my feature alone | I will keep essential files such as the main.py, model, api, README and fetch codes | Besides those I will have to completely wipe everything else so that the whole project is strictly mine. | .",

This problem showed us a spreadheet of infor about photos in a colection containing photographer, subject, year, and available variables. The question then asks which sequences could be used to dentify a desired entry after applying the above filters. I think I just made a silly mistake, buecause I knw it was sort by year, filter, photographer by looking at the table , but I then thought it was sirt by subject, year, and filter by photograoher as well, but it turns out that that would have an output of -1. THe correct answers overall would be B and D. | . Reflection . I’m getting better at these quizzes, and at this point I have just been getting tired/bored while taking the tests so I make silly mistakes.

In the code above, the schema, read, create, update, and delete methods are defined and used later in the program for the menu. This is an example of procedural abstraction because it provides a more modular approach to programming the menu, as we can call the defined methods based on what option the user chooses instead of defining them separately each time the user selects an option. . | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction?

Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . - A database schema is the blueprint or structure of a database. It defines how data is organized and how tables, fields, and relationships are designed within the database. A database schema includes the tables, columns, constraints, relationships, and other elements that define the structure of the database. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? An identity column in SQL database is a column that automatically generates a unique numeric value for each row that is added to a table. It is used to uniquely identify each row in the table and can be used as a primary key. Identity columns are often used in conjunction with auto-incrementing values. | . | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? The purpose of a primary key in SQL database is to uniquely identify each row in a table. A primary key is a column or set of columns that have a unique value for each row in the table. It is used to enforce data integrity and to create relationships between tables. A primary key can be used to join tables together and to ensure that each row in a table can be uniquely identified. | . | What are the Data Types in SQL table? Numeric data types: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, etc. | Character and string data types: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT, etc. | Date and time data types: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, etc. | Binary data types: BLOB, BINARY, VARBINARY, etc. | Other data types: BOOLEAN, ENUM, SET, JSON, XML, etc. | The specific data types available in SQL may vary depending on the database management system being used. | . | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . Schema is the Metadata for the databse | What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? This conn is an object that has variables and functions. | I think that this connection instantiates an obkect in order to connect our databse to a variable. | We connect to the database using SQLite3.connect | . | Same for cursor object?

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? The code for this create is much shorter. It requires the conn and cursor objects to be opened and closed. The cursor must execute a code which takes all of the variables and adds it to the table. | . | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? SQL INSERT allows rows to be added to an SQL database table. The User init function allows a dataset which is defined to be able to added to an SQL database. This serves a similar purpose. | . | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The hacked part of the update function outputs a message to the user if the length of the password is too short. This serves as authentication for the user to make sure that a password is long enough for security purposes. | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? Try and except work as things which check if certain code is running/working. Try runs if the code is working smoothly, and in this case serves to update the password. Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code. | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily. | . | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? DELETE can be a dangerous operation because it can remove information from the database, and if placed in the wrong hands, they could delete important information by accident. However, delete is also necessary in order to maintain a clean database with proper records. | . | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? In the print statements, the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} allow the coder to include the selected uid without having to add multiple strings in the print statement. It allows for easy replacement and making a statement which uses the variable which the user called for. | . | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? The menu repeats so the user has access to the functions multiple times if they want, instead of having to restart the code cell every time they want to try a new function. | . | Could you refactor this menu?

Data Compression . Q1 Advantage of lossless over lossy compression . The question asks us to determine what an advantage of lossless compressed algorithm over a lossy one. | Of course the only option that made sense was a lossless compression can guarentee reconsturction of original data, while lossy cannot. This is the obvious choice because this is the main difference between lossy and lossless that we learned, so this must be the correct answer | . Q2 Compression algorithm for storing a data file . The question gives us a situation of a user who wants to save a datafile on an online storage. They want to reduce the size of the file and they ask us which type would be the best in the case that they want to be able to restore the file to its original version | Of course the only right iption would be using a lossless compression, because being able to recover the file is the main purpose of using it. | . Q3 True Statement about compression . The question gives us a situation of a software developer for a social media platform. They want us to suggest whihch type of image compression they should use for their site. | They should most likely use lossy compression since it provices less transmission time, as the information is not necessarily lost when this type is used. | . Application of these questions . The main purpose of these questions were so that we were able to differentiate lossy and lossless image compression. I now am very familiar with their definitions. | I can apply this to my daily life, because I use social media every day, so I am now more familiar with the type of image compression that these social media companies most likely use. | . Extracting Information From Data . Q1 Challenge due to lack of unique ID . This question gives a situation about a reasearcher that is analyzing data about some students about a rrelationshiip between gpa and absences. They have access to a database, but it only takes into account the name of the students. | THe progblem askes us why is it bad to not have unique IDs for each student, and this is most defniately because you could possibly confuse two students if they have the same name./ | . Q2 Challenge in analyzing data from many counties . Some researches want to analyze pollution in 3000 US counties but they ask what a possible problem with this could be. | THe only correct option that would come to mind is that different counteies morganize data in different ways. This has to be true because the researchers cannot expect everyone to organize their data in the same way so it would be very hard to combine all their files into one spot and analyze them. | . Q3 Challemges with city data entered by users . The question asks us for possible problems with a program where users input a city name and info about it is outputted | The obvious problems that come to mind are that people might mispell or even enter abbreviations of the city, so the program would not take into account possible erros of the user. | . Q4 Determine Artist with the most concert attendees . The program has the purpsose of finding the greatest attneance of a few concerts ina month, and asks what type of data they should add besides date, revenue and artist. | The food and drinks, length of show, and start of show have absolutely nothing to do with the amount of tickets sold, and average ticket price would make sense to be able to count how mant people went since we already theoretically know how much money was made from tickets, so using the average ticket price would easily allow us to find a rough estimate of how many people showed up. | . Q5 Information determined using dashboard metadata . image data from the view of a car driver is sstored every second and captures the cars sepepd at theat specifc data and time. The problem asks what datapoint would be found without using metadate. | Of course this would be the bumber of bikes that passed by the car, since the rest of the options are found using averages or calculations (or metadate) based on the data given, while number of bikes is the only concrete data option. | . Q6 Information from student work habit survey . The question asks us to analyze what questions can be answered based on the responces from a survey that a teacher gave to their students. It aaks about how long hw takes, how long you study for tests, and if you enjoy those subjects | Based on these survey questions, the teacher would definately be able to answer which subjects the students like, since thats the entire last question (I) and be able to see if students spend more time studying or doing hw (II) so those are for sure the two right answer choices. | . Application of these questions . THese questions were very efficient and benefital in insuring that we are able to understand the different ways to extract data and be able to solve various problems in the methods to do so. It also checked in on if we understand what metadata is, which will definately prepare us for collegeboard well. | As a programmer, these questions will benefit me greatly, so I will know to always look for problems in a dataset that I am analyzing, as well as be able to understand what the outcome I want is thoroughly. | . Using Programs with Data . Q1 Bookstore Spreadsheet . The question gives us a spreadheet about some books in a bookstore where the employee wants to count the numebr of books that are a mystery, under $10 and have at least one copy in stock. | The expression that gives us that would for sure be &quot;(genre = &quot;mystery&quot;) AND ((1 ≤ num) AND (cost &lt; 10.00))&quot; because the output is supposed to reqire all of that data so AND would be required and OR statements would result to an output of false | . Q2 Clothing store ssales information . A store owner tracks dates, payment method, number of itmes, and dollars paid for every transaction and the question asks us which statemtn is true during a 7 day period. | The owner will of course be able to track the number of items purchased throughout that 7 week period since they can just add up the number of items purchased and matching that to the amount of transactions on each day. I don&#39;t see what this question has to do with programming is, but it was quite simple to solve. | . Q3 Data files to contact customers who use batteries . A company uses data files about their customers, products, and purchases. They want to know how to use these data files to determine who would be best fit to target in an email campaign for their rechargable batery pack. | THe best option would be to compare the customer IDs to items purchased IDs in order to determine the profiles which would possibly need or want this specific rechargable battery pack. | . Q4 Museum photograph spreadsheet . There is a spreadsheet of inofor about pics in a museums collection with the photographer, subject, year, abd publicly available (T/F) A program wants to find which photographer took the oldest picture in the collection and the problem asks how you would do so. | This is quite simple. The best option would be to filter by photographer and sort them by year, or vice versa. This would output the years of each photo, in order, as compared to the photographer that took the photos. | . Q5 Radio Show Spreadheet . A spreadsheet has info about the schedule for a college rado station inclding show name, gnere, day, start time, and end time. A programmer waantst o be able to count the number of shows that are both a talk show and on a Sat/Sun. | Of course te best expressoon to output a ture statemnt for this situation would be (genre = &quot;talk&quot;) AND ((day = &quot;Saturday&quot;) OR (day = &quot;Sunday&quot;)) because they must be a talk show AND either OR Sat/SUN which is filtered by the first AND statement that signifies that it requires both a talk show and on the specific date and the OR statemtn to signify either Sat or sunday. | . Use of Databases to display animal information . A preserve develops an exibit with various facts about each animal based on the selection that each guest makes. The preserve has two databases of information available to use for the exhibit. The first database contains information for each animal’s name, classification, skin type, and thermoregulation. The second database contains information for each animal’s name, lifestyle, average life span, and top speed. The problem asks how these daabases can help develop the interactive exhibit. | It is quite obvious that both of these databases are required for the information that they want to display at this interactive exhibit, because they contain the specific data that they are looking for. | . Application of these questions . These questions are moreover less about programming specifically but they gave us a great idea on how to analyze the data, specifc outputs, and purposes of various databases, datasets, and spreadsheets. | This will be very benefitial for our programming futures, since it gave us situations that could be very similar to those for our projects in the future, and gave us the problem solving and data analyzation skills neccessary in order to do so. | .

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival.

File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab It is important to know the file type of the image file, such as PNG or JPG, as different file types have different compression techniques and levels of compression | . | Size, height and width, number of pixels Size, height and width, number of pixels: The size of an image file is measured in terms of the number of pixels it contains, which is determined by its height and width. | The more pixels an image has, the larger its file size will be. It is important to consider the size of the image file as it can affect the loading time of the image. | . | Visual perception, lossy compression When compressing image files, it is important to consider how the compression will affect the visual quality of the image. Lossy compression techniques, which reduce file size by discarding some of the image data, can result in a loss of visual quality that may be noticeable to the human eye. | Data compression is the process of reducing the size of an image file by removing or compressing redundant information. This can be achieved through lossy or lossless compression techniques. Lossy compression techniques discard some of the image data, resulting in a smaller file size but reduced image quality, while lossless compression techniques maintain image quality but may not achieve as much compression. | . | . | . | . Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . Questions . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? ls - list the contents of the current directory | cd - change directory to a specified location | pwd - print the current working directory | mkdir - create a new directory | rm - remove a file or directory | cp - copy a file or directory | mv - move a file or directory | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? dir - list the contents of the current directory | cd - change directory to a specified location | cd.. - move up one directory level | md - create a new directory | rd - remove a directory | copy - copy a file or directory | move - move a file or directory | . | What are some of the major differences? One of the major differences between the two sets of commands is the syntax used. In Linux/Unix, commands and file paths are typically separated by forward slashes, while in Windows, they are separated by backslashes. | Additionally, Linux/Unix commands are often shorter and more concise, using single-letter flags to modify their behavior, while Windows commands are often longer and more descriptive, using full words and phrases to specify options and parameters. | Another difference is that Windows commands are typically case-insensitive, while Linux/Unix commands are case-sensitive. | . | Why is path a big deal when working with images? Path is a big deal when working with images because it allows the software or application to locate the image file on the computer or network. Without the correct path, the software or application will not be able to find and display the image. This is particularly important when working with images in programming, where the path is specified in code and needs to be accurate. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? The metadata source and label are important in Unit 5 topics, particularly in the context of supervised learning. Metadata such as image dimensions, file type, and compression type can provide useful information about the image and help in preprocessing and feature extraction. | Labels can also provide important information about the image, such as the object or category it belongs to, which can be used to train and test machine learning models. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython is an interactive command-line shell for Python that provides enhanced functionality, such as tab completion, object introspection, and inline plotting. It is particularly useful in Jupyter Notebooks, where it allows for interactive exploration and analysis of data. In Jupyter Notebooks, IPython can be used with both Pandas and Images. With Pandas, IPython allows for interactive data exploration and manipulation, making it easier to analyze and clean data. | With Images, IPython can be used to display and manipulate images inline, allowing for real-time visualization and preprocessing of images. This can be especially useful in computer vision tasks where image preprocessing and analysis is an important part of the workflow. | . | . | . | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) .

Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. #### Questions | . | Where have you been a consumer of buffering? As a consumer, buffering is a common issue that I often encounter. Buffering occurs when the playback of media content is interrupted due to slow internet connection, network congestion, or limited system resources. When buffering occurs, the media content will stop playing and a loading icon or message may be displayed while the content is being buffered. This is really annoying and a big part of my digital expirience. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? Interruptions in media playback: Buffering can cause interruptions in media playback, which can be frustrating for the consumer, especially if the content is being streamed in real-time or contains important information. | Delayed or slow playback: Buffering can cause delayed or slow playback, which can negatively affect the user&#39;s experience and perception of the quality of the media content. | Reduced image quality: Buffering can cause the image quality of media content to be reduced due to compression and other techniques used to speed up buffering. | . | How do these effects apply to images? In the context of images, buffering may occur when displaying large images or when loading images from a slow network or storage device. | This can result in delayed or slow image loading, which can affect the user&#39;s experience and perception of the image quality. | In addition, images that are compressed or resized for faster loading may lose some of their quality and detail, which can negatively impact the user&#39;s viewing experience. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and Working with Images . Most data structures classes require Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Since this class is lined up with a College Course, OOP will be talked about often. Functionality in remainder of this Blog is the same as the prior implementation . Imperative Programing . a programming paradigm that emphasizes giving the computer a set of instructions to follow, which are executed sequentially. It is often compared to a list of steps that a person might take to complete a task. | . | Imperative programming languages focus on the &quot;how&quot; of a task rather than the &quot;what&quot; or &quot;why&quot;. Examples of imperative programming languages include C, Fortran, and Assembly | . OOP . a programming paradigm that focuses on objects as the fundamental unit of programming. OOP is based on the idea that objects are made up of data and behavior, and that objects interact with each other to perform tasks. The key features of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. | Examples of OOP languages include Java, Python, and Ruby. | . | . Differences . Data and behavior:In imperative programming, data and behavior are often separate, and functions or procedures manipulate data. In OOP, data and behavior are encapsulated within objects.- Procedural vs. Object-Oriented: Imperative programming is often procedural, meaning that it relies on a series of procedures or functions to accomplish a task. OOP is based on objects that interact with each other to accomplish a task. | Abstraction: OOP provides abstraction, meaning that objects can hide their internal workings and expose only a public interface. Imperative programming is less abstract, and typically exposes more of the internal workings of a program. | Flexibility: OOP is generally more flexible and adaptable than imperative programming, due to its ability to encapsulate data and behavior within objects. Imperative programming can be more rigid, as it is often based on a series of procedures or functions that are executed sequentially. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Liav Bar&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;smiley face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley2.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

Data Structures and OOP Code and Notes . Questions . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? . A grayscale algorithm converts a color image into a black and white image by removing the color information and retaining only the luminance or brightness values of each pixel. The algorithm works as follows: Load the color image into memory. | Iterate through each pixel of the image. | For each pixel, calculate the grayscale value using the formula: | grayscale = (0.299 red) + (0.587 green) + (0.114 * blue) where red, green, and blue are the color values of the pixel. | Assign the calculated grayscale value to the pixel. | Save the grayscale image to disk. | | . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? . A scaled image is an image that has been resized to either be smaller or larger than its original size. Scaling an image involves changing the number of pixels that make up the image, which can affect its overall quality and clarity. | In order to scale an image, a mathematical formula is used to determine how the pixels should be adjusted. | When scaling an image to be larger, new pixels are added to the image to increase its size. Conversely, when scaling an image to be smaller, some of the original pixels are removed or combined to decrease its size. | Examples: . Image 1: Original size: 1000 x 1000 pixels Scaled size: 500 x 500 pixels (50% of original size) . | Image 2: Original size: 1000 x 1000 pixels Scaled size: 2000 x 2000 pixels (200% of original size) . | Image 3: Original size: 1000 x 1000 pixels Scaled size: 100 x 100 pixels (10% of original size) . | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scaling an image is not considered a type of compression because it does not involve any reduction in the file size of the image. When an image is compressed, the file size is reduced by either removing some of the data or by encoding the data in a more efficient way. Compression is usually used to reduce the file size of an image to make it easier to store, transmit or load. | . | On the other hand, scaling an image is simply a process of resizing the image to make it larger or smaller without reducing its file size or changing its format. Scaling an image can, however, impact the visual quality of the image. If the image is scaled down, the reduction in the number of pixels may lead to loss of details or blurriness. If the image is scaled up, it may result in pixelation or distortion. | . | . | . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np class Image_Data: def __init__(self, source, label, file, path, baseWidth=320): self._source = source # variables with self prefix become part of the object, self._label = label self._file = file self._filename = path / file # file with path self._baseWidth = baseWidth # Open image and scale to needs self._img = pilImage.open(self._filename) self._format = self._img.format self._mode = self._img.mode self._originalSize = self.img.size self.scale_image() self._html = self.image_to_html(self._img) self._html_grey = self.image_to_html_grey() @property def source(self): return self._source @property def label(self): return self._label @property def file(self): return self._file @property def filename(self): return self._filename @property def img(self): return self._img @property def format(self): return self._format @property def mode(self): return self._mode @property def originalSize(self): return self._originalSize @property def size(self): return self._img.size @property def html(self): return self._html @property def html_grey(self): return self._html_grey # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(self): scalePercent = (self._baseWidth/float(self._img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(self._img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (self._baseWidth, scaleHeight) self._img = self._img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_html(self, img): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, self._format) return &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_to_html_grey(self): img_grey = self._img numpy = np.array(self._img.getdata()) # PIL image to numpy array grey_data = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in numpy: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: grey_data.append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: grey_data.append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img_grey.putdata(grey_data) return self.image_to_html(img_grey) # prepares a series of images, provides expectation for required contents def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Liav Bar&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;smiley face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley2.png&quot;} ] return path, images # turns data into objects def image_objects(): id_Objects = [] path, images = image_data() for image in images: id_Objects.append(Image_Data(source=image[&#39;source&#39;], label=image[&#39;label&#39;], file=image[&#39;file&#39;], path=path, )) return id_Objects # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: for ido in image_objects(): # ido is an Imaged Data Object print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(ido.label) print(ido.source) print(ido.file) print(ido.format) print(ido.mode) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, ido.originalSize) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, ido.size) print(&quot;-- scaled image --&quot;) display(HTML(ido.html)) print(&quot; grey image &quot;) display(HTML(ido.html_grey)) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet green-square-16.png PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- scaled image -- . grey image . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin clouds-impression.png PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- scaled image -- . grey image . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin lassen-volcano.jpg JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- scaled image -- . grey image . - meta data -- smiley face Liav Bar smiley2.png JPEG RGB Original size: (497, 499) Scaled size: (320, 321) -- scaled image -- . grey image . .

Choose 2 images, one that will more likely result in lossy data compression and one that is more likely to result in lossless data compression. Explain. Here are two sample images, one that is more likely to result in lossy compression and one that is more likely to result in lossless compression: | . | . Lossy Compression: . The image above is a photograph of a tree, which contains a lot of detail and varying colors. This type of image is more likely to result in lossy compression because lossy compression techniques work by removing some of the details and color information that the human eye may not perceive. | In this image, lossy compression could reduce the number of colors, blur some edges, and remove some fine details, resulting in a smaller file size. | . Lossless Compression: . The image above is a landscape photograph of a desert, which contains large areas of the same color and fewer details than the tree photograph. This type of image is more likely to result in lossless compression because lossless compression techniques work by finding patterns and redundancies in the data and encoding them in a more efficient way. In this specific image, lossless compression could be achieved by encoding the areas of the same color using fewer bits and by finding patterns in the pixels that repeat. The result would be a smaller file size, but with no loss of detail or quality. | In general, lossy compression is best suited for images with a lot of detail and color variation, such as photographs, while lossless compression is more suitable for images with large areas of the same color and fewer details, such as diagrams, charts, or graphs. | . | . Project Addition . If your project has images in it, try to implement an image change that has a purpose. (Ex.

Lossy compression techniques, which reduce file size by discarding some of the image data, can result in a loss of visual quality that may be noticeable to the human eye. | Data compression is the process of reducing the size of an image file by removing or compressing redundant information. This can be achieved through lossy or lossless compression techniques. Lossy compression techniques discard some of the image data, resulting in a smaller file size but reduced image quality, while lossless compression techniques maintain image quality but may not achieve as much compression. | . | . | . | .

Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS’s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . Questions . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? ls - list the contents of the current directory | cd - change directory to a specified location | pwd - print the current working directory | mkdir - create a new directory | rm - remove a file or directory | cp - copy a file or directory | mv - move a file or directory | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? dir - list the contents of the current directory | cd - change directory to a specified location | cd.. - move up one directory level | md - create a new directory | rd - remove a directory | copy - copy a file or directory | move - move a file or directory | . | What are some of the major differences? One of the major differences between the two sets of commands is the syntax used. In Linux/Unix, commands and file paths are typically separated by forward slashes, while in Windows, they are separated by backslashes. | Additionally, Linux/Unix commands are often shorter and more concise, using single-letter flags to modify their behavior, while Windows commands are often longer and more descriptive, using full words and phrases to specify options and parameters. | Another difference is that Windows commands are typically case-insensitive, while Linux/Unix commands are case-sensitive. | . | Why is path a big deal when working with images? Path is a big deal when working with images because it allows the software or application to locate the image file on the computer or network. Without the correct path, the software or application will not be able to find and display the image. This is particularly important when working with images in programming, where the path is specified in code and needs to be accurate. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? The metadata source and label are important in Unit 5 topics, particularly in the context of supervised learning. Metadata such as image dimensions, file type, and compression type can provide useful information about the image and help in preprocessing and feature extraction. | Labels can also provide important information about the image, such as the object or category it belongs to, which can be used to train and test machine learning models. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython is an interactive command-line shell for Python that provides enhanced functionality, such as tab completion, object introspection, and inline plotting. It is particularly useful in Jupyter Notebooks, where it allows for interactive exploration and analysis of data. In Jupyter Notebooks, IPython can be used with both Pandas and Images. With Pandas, IPython allows for interactive data exploration and manipulation, making it easier to analyze and clean data. | With Images, IPython can be used to display and manipulate images inline, allowing for real-time visualization and preprocessing of images. This can be especially useful in computer vision tasks where image preprocessing and analysis is an important part of the workflow. | . | . | . | . . Reading and Encoding Images . When we are now working on this data and images unit | . Base 64 . converts binary encoded data into an encoded scheme of 24 bits and 6 base64 bits. It is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS | First 3 letters of my name in Base64: TGlh Numpy . | . | an artificial intelligence data science tool Mort uses them to manipulate and grab images io, BytesIO . | . | Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. Questions . | . | Where have you been a consumer of buffering? As a consumer, buffering is a common issue that I often encounter. Buffering occurs when the playback of media content is interrupted due to slow internet connection, network congestion, or limited system resources. When buffering occurs, the media content will stop playing and a loading icon or message may be displayed while the content is being buffered. This is really annoying and a big part of my digital expirience. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? Interruptions in media playback: Buffering can cause interruptions in media playback, which can be frustrating for the consumer, especially if the content is being streamed in real-time or contains important information. | Delayed or slow playback: Buffering can cause delayed or slow playback, which can negatively affect the user’s experience and perception of the quality of the media content. | Reduced image quality: Buffering can cause the image quality of media content to be reduced due to compression and other techniques used to speed up buffering. | . | How do these effects apply to images? In the context of images, buffering may occur when displaying large images or when loading images from a slow network or storage device. | This can result in delayed or slow image loading, which can affect the user’s experience and perception of the image quality. | In addition, images that are compressed or resized for faster loading may lose some of their quality and detail, which can negatively impact the user’s viewing experience. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and Working with Images . Most data structures classes require Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Since this class is lined up with a College Course, OOP will be talked about often. Functionality in remainder of this Blog is the same as the prior implementation . Imperative Programing . a programming paradigm that emphasizes giving the computer a set of instructions to follow, which are executed sequentially. It is often compared to a list of steps that a person might take to complete a task. | . | Imperative programming languages focus on the “how” of a task rather than the “what” or “why”. Examples of imperative programming languages include C, Fortran, and Assembly | . OOP . a programming paradigm that focuses on objects as the fundamental unit of programming. OOP is based on the idea that objects are made up of data and behavior, and that objects interact with each other to perform tasks. The key features of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. | Examples of OOP languages include Java, Python, and Ruby. | . | . Differences . Data and behavior: In imperative programming, data and behavior are often separate, and functions or procedures manipulate data. In OOP, data and behavior are encapsulated within objects. | Procedural vs. Object-Oriented: Imperative programming is often procedural, meaning that it relies on a series of procedures or functions to accomplish a task. OOP is based on objects that interact with each other to accomplish a task. | Abstraction: OOP provides abstraction, meaning that objects can hide their internal workings and expose only a public interface. Imperative programming is less abstract, and typically exposes more of the internal workings of a program. | Flexibility: OOP is generally more flexible and adaptable than imperative programming, due to its ability to encapsulate data and behavior within objects. Imperative programming can be more rigid, as it is often based on a series of procedures or functions that are executed sequentially. | . . Questions . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? A grayscale algorithm converts a color image into a black and white image by removing the color information and retaining only the luminance or brightness values of each pixel. The algorithm works as follows: Load the color image into memory. | Iterate through each pixel of the image. | For each pixel, calculate the grayscale value using the formula: | grayscale = (0.299 * red) + (0.587 * green) + (0.114 * blue) where red, green, and blue are the color values of the pixel. | Assign the calculated grayscale value to the pixel. | Save the grayscale image to disk. | | . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? A scaled image is an image that has been resized to either be smaller or larger than its original size. Scaling an image involves changing the number of pixels that make up the image, which can affect its overall quality and clarity. | In order to scale an image, a mathematical formula is used to determine how the pixels should be adjusted. | When scaling an image to be larger, new pixels are added to the image to increase its size. Conversely, when scaling an image to be smaller, some of the original pixels are removed or combined to decrease its size. | Examples: Image 1: Original size: 1000 x 1000 pixels Scaled size: 500 x 500 pixels (50% of original size) . | Image 2: Original size: 1000 x 1000 pixels Scaled size: 2000 x 2000 pixels (200% of original size) . | Image 3: Original size: 1000 x 1000 pixels Scaled size: 100 x 100 pixels (10% of original size) . | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scaling an image is not considered a type of compression because it does not involve any reduction in the file size of the image. When an image is compressed, the file size is reduced by either removing some of the data or by encoding the data in a more efficient way. Compression is usually used to reduce the file size of an image to make it easier to store, transmit or load. | . | On the other hand, scaling an image is simply a process of resizing the image to make it larger or smaller without reducing its file size or changing its format. Scaling an image can, however, impact the visual quality of the image. If the image is scaled down, the reduction in the number of pixels may lead to loss of details or blurriness. If the image is scaled up, it may result in pixelation or distortion. | . | . | . | . . 2.2 Data Compression Hacks . | .",

I originally thought that using this smart home device could reveal the users passwords but now that I think about it, it makes no sense because you are not telling the smart home device any passwords. It only makes sense that phishing in this scenario would be if an email is sent to user from supposedly the company. I dont know how the scammer would know that they purchased the smart home, but this seems to be the most relevent phishing opportunity. | . Question: 19 . . When looking at this FOR loop it looked to me as if all the elemints in list1 then list 2 are contents of the result because the if statemt for List2 is located within the IN List1 code segment, but this is also because I did not know what append means. In reality, the output would be only emlements in both List1 and List2 because List1 is originally empty, due to the IF isfound. Not a silly mistake, I was just a bit confused on what this code meant. | . Question: 29 . . When looking at this code segment I thought the output would be true true ture, but I could not have been more wrong. I completely misunderstood the code, and now see that it was actually false false false because A and C were orignallay assigned false with statements 4 and 5, an B does not change after its orignally assigned false. This was a very silly mistake, I don’t think I was paying attention to the detail in the moment. | . Question: 50 . . For this probelm I simply misclicked C and immediately went and pressed the submit button. This was as silly of a mistake as it gets. This was a very simple problem and I knew the correct answers but I just misclicked. It is very obvious to see that Algorithm C does not run efficiently (along with B) while A and D run linearly and exponentially which is very efficient in comparisson to the list size. | . Reflection . Overall I think I did very well on this MC once again and I am definately getting better at answering the questions about actual code. My 4 mistakes were relatively silly, except question 19 when I did not know what “append” meant. My mistakes will be resolved once I go deeper into the college board content. | .",

            "title": "Create a Performance Task Writeup for Stats Feature",
            "content": "Video . Writeup . 3.a . 3.a.i . The program presents an interactive table that logs the gym statistics of the user, to serve as a way for them to track their improvement in the gym. | . 3.a.ii. . The program allows the user to insert on a table their growing age, improved weight (to their liking gaining or losing), max bench press, squat, pullup, and mile time. The specific stats that the user inputs are then placed onto a table where the user can view their history of improvement based on all the inputs they have made over the time they have been using it. | . 3.a.iii. . There are 6 inputs that the user types their specific data into manually: Age, weight, bench, squat, pullup, mile. These inputs are then signified by a “create” button which the user can click on using their moude that outputs their data onto the table. This is the process that is demonstrated in the video. | . 3.b . 3.b.i . . . . . 3.b.ii . . 3.b.iii . There is one collection method displayed, which is a database. The database is called Class Athlete. It specifically names Age, Weight, Bench, Squat, and Pullup into the databse of stats that are assigned to “Athlete” or the user. This data then goes into the specifc “Elite” table that is assinged to the athlete. | . 3.b.iv. . The data that is being stored into this database is Age, Weight, Bench, Squat, Pullup, Mile can be seen to be integers. These integers are inputted by the user and represent the max or improved or declined stats that the user endured over the period of time of their choosing. These inputs would have no purpose without this database that they are stored in and assinged to the corresponding variables. | . 3.b.v. . The database managaes the complexity of this stat tracking program as the program could never work without it. Without this database, the inputs that the user completes on the frontend would go nowhere and there would be no program entirely. Due to the abundance of this database, the stats that are inputted by the user can be saved and ultimately outputted onto the frontend table. | . 3.c. . 3.c.i. . Procedure with Parameters: | . . . Call: | . . . . 3.c.ii . . . . 3.c.iii . These code segments display the two procedures that are abundant in this program: Create function and read function. Both functions utilize the parameters of Age, Weight, Bench, Squat, Pullup, Mile. The functions both utilize the data that was inputted by the user which is jsonified into json formatted data. This data is then fetched seperately into the create (post) and read functions. The read function displays the data onto the table which allows the user to see it. Whereas the create function allows the user to input new data that is then outputted using the read function. Overall, the Create function allows for the user input while the read function allows for the output that is seen on the front end. | . 3.c.iv. . This program utilizes Iteration in the first code segment that is displayed. The function repeats the error message “(specific variable) is missing, or is less than 1 character” everytime the user trys to input a stat or data that is less than one character or does not input any data at all. This Error message will iterate until the requirement of at least 1 character is met in each input box. This algorithm is repeated 6 times for the 6 different variabes. The algorithm contains an if statement that declares that if the input of the specific variable is either nonexistent (none) or less than one character (len(Age)&lt;1) then the function will return a 400 error and the message. | The program then utilizaes Sequencing in the second code segment that is displayed. This is located in the create function of the program in which the user creates/inputs their personal statistics. The sequence instructs that for the input of Athlete (the user) it will print the output of the athlete.create() function unless there is an integrity error. This is done by utilizing a for … in statement, specifically “for” the name of the class and “in” the user specifically. Then it writes “try:” in order to displau the print of the function that was prior created. Furthermore, it writes “except” when there is an integrity erorr and instructs the code to print the error message in this case. | Finally, the program utilizes selection in the third code segment that is displayed. This is defined in the “create” function portion of the program. This selection signifies that only the inputs for each specific datapoin/stat that is inputed by the user that has any length (really meaning that only inputs with actual characters) will be selected as data that is used in the function. This is done by definding the variables at the start when defining the function itself, then using an if statement (that is repeated for each variable) which writes that if the input of that age is greater than 0 then the self function (assigns data to the user) will actually carry through on. | . 3.d. . 3.d.i . First call: The first call is a fetch from the create function that is used to save the data that is inputted by the user (in json format) onto the database and eventually onto the front end. It fetches the json data from the database and resonds it into the datatable using response.json. | Second Call: The second call is a fetch from the read function that is used to bring the data that is already stored into the database (in json format) in a viewable format on the front end. It fetches the json data from the database and resonds it into the datatable using response.json. | . 3.d.ii. . Condition(s) tested by first call: The first call tests the condition that the data is in json format, that this json data alligns with the conditions that must be met in order for the create function to run (an integer with at least one character), and of course tests whether the Age, Weight, Bench, Squat, Pullup, Mile data were actully inputted or not. | Condition(s) tested by second call: The second call solely tests whether the data that is fetched for the read function is in json format, and if the data was part of the self (athlete) database. | . 3.d.iii. . Results of the first call: The result of the first call is creating data that is inputted by the user and formatting it onto the database. | Results of the second call: The result of the second call is formatting the data that is already located in the database in json and displaying it in a readable manner fashion. | .",

Textbooks are “way more reliable” but really textbooks are only written from the perspective of a few people who wrote it. | Wiki is actually a good thing because it utilizes crowdsourcing. Anyone can list their perspective on a subject. | Textbooks are bias based on the location and ideals at which they are written, so they are technically bias. | . Discuss APIs I have Used . The most prevalent API I have used is a Yahoo Weather API that took in the data from millions of cities in order to output the temp, weather, humidity, etc of all these cities. This crowdsources the weather inputs of a diverse range of people and areas. | The greatest discovery I have found on github is the ability to connect your repositories to vscode and invite collaborators through github to code on your vscode. This integration is extremely interesting to me. This utilizes crowdsourcing because it allows a vast diversification of members to help you code. | . Hacks . 5.3 Bias Hacks . Facebook vs TikTok: Facebook was the original popular social media platform, but now all its users are grown up, so at this point it is viewed as an old people social media. On the other hand, younger generations prevalently use tiktok, because it is newer and adjusts to their depleting attention spans with endless entertainment. | Both Facebook and TikTok have faced criticism for their algorithmic biases and for excluding certain content or demographics. Whether this exclusion is purposeful or not is a matter of debate. However, it is generally considered harmful as it can lead to unequal representation and opportunities for certain groups. The correction of algorithmic biases is important for promoting fairness and inclusion. Whether it is good business or not depends on the company’s priorities and values. I personally think it is though, because they make billions in ad revenue for it. | . | Amazon, Alexa, Google, Apple Siri: The difficulty in detecting accents or young voices in these virtual assistants has been widely reported and has led to criticism of the companies. This could be due to a variety of factors, including the limited diversity of the data used to train the systems or a lack of attention to the issue. Female voices do evidently have a softer tone and connotation in their voice, so it makes sense that they use a female voice everyday. This can be harmful as it can limit diversity for certain groups. Additionally this could demean females themselves because the female voice is viewed as that of an assistant. I think that there is no need to be corrected however, because each company has numerous options for your voice assistant. This is good business and is not harmful at all. | . | Netflix, Google Algorithm: First of all, when you search something up on google, there are only so many links that are put in front of you. Due to this, there is potential for a coder at google to implement their bias into the search results that pop up. There have been allegations that Netflix’s algorithm biases certain content to certain viewers. The purpose of this is to improve the viewing experience for each user. However, this can also result in unequal representation and opportunities for certain content creators. Whether this is harmful or good business is a matter of debate, but it is important for companies to be transparent about their algorithmic processes and ensure that they are fair and inclusive. | . | HP Racism video questions The situation is that the face tracking capability of the HP computer webcam works perfectly on a white woman but malfunctions and does not work with black people. | The owner definately does not believe that this malfunction was intentional, you can tell because he clearly jokes around about it being racist. | I think this occured due to the failure to use black subjects when testing this technology. | I do not believe that this is harmful in any way, because there were no intentions to be racist. HP obviously simply made the mistake of not using colored subjects when testing their facial tracking. | This issue should most definately be corrected, and it probably has since this video is from 2009. | I think you should have a diverse range of test subjects when creating a technology based on the outside looks of an individual. If we do this everytime without fail, we will never have an issue like this again. | . | . Overall Takeaway . Though much of it is certainly not intentional, it is evident that there is much bias in Americas largest companies. This teaches us the lesson to ensure that there is no bias in our code or algorithms. | . 5.4 Crowdsource Hacks . To initiate crowd-sourcing for a class of 150 computer science students we can Divide the class into groups: Depending on the size of the task, divide the class into smaller groups of 4-5 students each and define the problem or task: Clearly state the problem or task you want the students to solve or contribute to | We can also Set up a platform and Choose an appropriate platform, such as GitHub, Google Drive or a project management tool, for the students to collaborate and submit their work, furthermore we will Assign each student a specific role such as a project manager, researcher, developer, or designer. | Provide guidelines: Provide clear guidelines and instructions for the students on how to collaborate, communicate, and submit their work | Regularly monitoring the progress of the students and provide feedback and guidance where necessary. Another important task we can do is evaluate the submissions based on the guidelines and criteria provided, and provide feedback to the students. | . | Crowd-Sourcing for our fitness program. To implement crowd sourcing in a fitness tracking web app we can: Encourage user engagement: Provide incentives for users to share their fitness data, such as challenges, rewards, or recognition on a leaderboard. | Collect and store user data by Creating a database or use an API to collect and store user-generated fitness data, such as workout routines, progress, and other metrics. | Implement data sharing features: Allow users to share their fitness data with others, either through social media integration, direct sharing with friends, or by making it public to all users. | Analyze the crowd-sourced data to provide insights, generate personalized recommendations, or create a community-wide analysis of trends and patterns. | Foster a community by encouraging users to engage with one another and provide resources such as forums, discussion boards, or messaging systems to facilitate collaboration and support. | . | .",

            "content": "My Feature: Athlete Stats . . Overview . My feature is a stats tracker that allows users to track their physical and fitness growth. | When you type a new max in a certain category and click “add” then it will add to the top of the graph | As you can see, it has tabs to add a new max for Weight, Height, Bench, and Squat, but I am planning on adding more options in the future. | It also has a functional delete entry tab, but it is not very simple to use. | . Goals to add for future . I would like to add a bar that displays only the maxes for every stat they have logged, on top of the graph of all of them. | I would like to make the delete entry feature more simple, at the moment its kind of confusing to use. | I definately need to figure out how to save the data onto a datebase for each user, rather than locally on the browser. | I also would add more options to the table, at the end, because this is obviously a very easy feature to add. I want to keep the current one as simple as possible so it will be easier to get the hard things done. | . College Board Describe Portion . Line 1: Program Purpose and Function . This program will be made by utilizting two github repositories (one for backend and one for frontend) and vscode for the coding itself. | Purpose is to Allow users to log their physical progress/growth and Provide Users a simple way to track their max weight for various exercises | Functionality: Stats tracker that allows users to track their physical and fitness growth. When you type a new max in a certain category and click “add” then it will add to the top of the graph | Input your new max for height, weight, bench, squat etc. | Output: The user input is then outputted onto two seperate charts. One that is meant as a log for all the new maxes you have had (with dates) and one that simply displays all of your maxes. | . Line 2: Data Abstraction . The first code segment will display the stats that a user inputted being stored into a database of somesort that I will code in the future | This data will then be called and printed onto the two charts. | The name of the variable will be “Athlete” | The data contained in this list represents the statistics of the athlete, which the whole purpose of my program is to document. | . Line 3: Managing Complexity . My data abstraction will be met using a database, but the list I will create will have to do with the printing of the data of each user. The list will contain the data and be assigned to a variable, rather than printing each individual data point | The data will be named to the “Athlete” variable, and the program would not function without this list because the table would not not the athlete to which each max weight represents. | . Line 4: Procedural Abstraction . The procedure I will be coding will involve creating the table that displays the max of each parameter which are the weight, height, bench, squat, etc. | This procedure will be called by defining the procedure eventually then printing it later. | This procedure takes the maximum value from each parameter, that has been inputed by the user, and contributes to the functionality of the program because the function needs this procedure (that takes the max numerical input for each parameter) to work. | . Line 5: Algorithm Implementation . Iteration: The algorithm will iterate through the users history of logging maxes to find the max max for each weight. | Selection: The algorithm will analzye the all the maxes they have reached and how recent to select to the user which exersize(s) they have made the most progress in | Sequencing: The algorithm will analyze the logs the users have made of their maxes and supply their history of which exersizes they have hit the most. | I will be able to explain how this algorithm works in detail, once I actually code it. | . Line 6: Testing . There will be 4 (or more depending on each datapoint that I add) calls, based on each exersize max that I code. | The condition that will be tested is the how great the number is in comparison to every other number that has been inputted for that parameter. Basically the condition is if it is the greatest weight that has been inputted for that exersize. | The result of each call, for the max weight table, will be the max weight (of each parameter) that was abstracted from the procedure. | If Age &gt; 18 then print min weight, ifelse print max weight. | . What I Will Show in My Video . In my video I will would show the input of different maxes for each exersize on different dates. These inputs would then be outputted on the main chart or “stats table” that logs all of the maxes. Everytime I add a new max to a the main chart, it will also update the “max table” which would imply my algorithm, procedure, complexity, testing, abstraction, and function. As a bonus I would show that I can delete any entry as well. | .",

            "content": "Answers I Got Incorrect . . Question 15 Robot in Maze . . After relooking at this problem, it seems far too easy for me to have gotten wrong. I honestly don’t know what I was thinking, the answer was obvious. I just needed to follow what the code was saying to see if the robot could make it to the gray square, and the only one that wouldnt work based on the given algorithm is D. | . Question 25 Infinite Repeat Until Loop . . This problem was quite confusing to me, as I didn’t really understand what the problem was asking from me. Now that I read it again, I see that it was asking for a condition to be met that will make the function loop infinitely. Reading it again, I see that J =1 and is getting added to 2, meaning that the loop will end when J is an odd number, so my answer of j=7 cannot be correct. Instead the answer must be j=6 because an even number will make the function never be true so it will never end. This question makes sense to me now. | . Question 38 Result of Procedure Mystery with Parameter Number . . I think I read the problem slightly wrong when answering this question, because now when I reread it, I can see that my answer makes no sense and that the obvious answer is C. The mystery Procedure writes that when the number is greater than 0, it subtracts 2 until the outcome is 0, which is even. If the initial number was odd then the function would never be true because subtracting 2 from an odd number will never equal an even number. Therefore the function will output true when the initial number is even, and false if it is odd. This procedure makes sense to me now, and I just need to pay more attention to what the problem is asking from me and to read each code segment carefully. | . Question 48 Reducing Number of Operations in List Average . . This is another example of me not really understanding what the problem is asking from me, and now that I reread the problem again, I can tell the mistake I made. At first all I understood was making a correct program, I assumed that the program was already correct and I realized that flipping 6 and 7 would be essentially the same program, so I decided that that would be the correct answer. Now that I read the problem again, I see that it was asking for a reduced numebr of operations, and after analyzing the choices again, I realize that interchanging lines 7 and 8 would only calculate the average once becayse ut would take the sum/count out of the {}. Once again, I need to pay more attention to and understand what the problem is asking. | . Overall Thoughts . I think these collegeboard MCs are really good practice for the real AP test. I am definately much better at all the terminology than I was in tri 1, since this trimester we did a lot of learning of the collegeboard knowledge through the student lessons. After those, I really got the gist of the information that collegeboard wants us to know, so I could definitely answer these questions much better and efficiently than before. I did pretty well: 46/50, and I feel like the only mistake I’ve mainly been making is not understanding what the problem is asking from me. Other than that I feel like the learning we have done in the 2nd trimester has really developed my knowledge of the subject, which translates to better MC scores. | .",

Testing | 0 | 0 | Did not describe any of the calls and did not ue any arguments that use paramters. | . My Score: 5/6 . College Board Score: 5/6 . Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard? . This one was very easy to grade because it had everything perfectly until the Testing requiremnt where they did it so poorly that it was easy to take away that point. | . Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard . For the testing category I feel that that barely even looked at the requirements and described none of the calls, and just the code themselves which is obviously not what college board asked to. Overall a great project but it could have been perfect if they paid more attention to the last requirement. | . Overall Reflection: . Overall, these college board scoring assingments were extremely beneficial in teaching me how to get a great score on my own CPT project. Prior to these assignemtns, I barely knew what one of these projects were supposed to look like, but now I have a great perspective and many ideas of what I can do to make my one. This assigment especially taught me all the ways to meet colllegeboards requirements, such as the extreme detail that is needed in explainations of certain things like functionality vs contribution to program. Additionally paying close details to the requirements is going to be extremely important, because one small slip up will lose an entire point. FInally, comparing the best and the worst projects really gave me a perspective on how I am going to do my own project and how I will be going above and beyond in order to ensure the perfection of my own CPT. | .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Init Method . In programming, the init method is a special method in a class or object that is used to initialize or set up the object&#39;s properties when it is first created. It is often used to assign default values to the object&#39;s properties, or to perform other setup tasks that need to happen when the object is first created. The method is usually named init() in Python, it&#39;s a constructor method that gets called when an object is created. | . Schema . In programming, a schema is a blueprint or structure for organizing and storing data in a database. In the context of tables, a schema defines the structure of the table, including the names and data types of the columns, as well as any constraints or rules that apply to the data stored in the table. A schema can also specify relationships between tables and enforce integrity constraints to ensure the data is consistent and accurate. | . Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

Ofcourse, all of these have not been completely coded, but rather have been made progress upon. . More about the features . homepage: The homepage includes the navbar and details about our web-app Etracker (name subject to change). The homepage will have clickable elements where the user can click to find more information about the web-app. | Workout logger: The workout logger includes the navbar at the top and the workout tracker. The user can click the add workout button to, well, add a workout. The user can then click on which workout to log (still in development). | Navbar: The navbar nearly done. We still need to code the login button to do what it’s supposed to, which is to redirect to a login page. We are planning to use oauth2 for the login. The login page will be designed shortly. The navbar includes all the pages that will be on the website. | Difficulties experienced . Sure, it doesn’t seem like a lot of features have been coded, but that is because we am doing extensive research on how to get the features to work. | For example, We were doing research on the workout logger, but it had to be cutshort inorder for the navbar to be developed. Talking about the navbar, it was a pain in the butt to get it to work. Other files from the leuck project interefered with it and caused a bunch of errors. For example, the workout logger had bugged out and wasn’t displaying/working how it is supposed to. | So far, the easiest has been the CSS. We only had to search up the type of code we needed and followed tutorials to make it look how we want it to. | . | . Few ways we modularized/ increased efficiency in our code . The first way we did this is through dividing elements into different files (organized in folders) to make the code look more polished. We did this by linking the files into the html. For example, we would not code the JS into the html file. | We rather added a source to the script tag and then linked the separate JS file to the script. | . | We also used scss to make our UI development more efficient. SCSS features such as mixins and vars were crucial and saved a lot of copy-pasta time. | . Next steps towards the frontend development . This week there will be strict deadlines towards the frontend development. | The main features that will need to be designed are: Log in page, completed workout tracker, and completed homepage. The user customization will also have been touched upon. More information will be on the scrumboard. | . Project Frontend Progress: . Homepage and Nav bar (with code) . . .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Explaination . As you can see, I made a function that is very similar to the class function from before, except it tailors to my groups CPT project. My group is doing a fitness tracker webapp for our CPT, so this function is based on an athlete | . | I began with constructing the Weight and Bench attributes that signify how much an athlete weighs and bench presses | I then used the Setter and Getter method to call them | Finally I assigned each attribute to Athlete1 and Athlete2 and printed them. | . Later Edits . In later edits, Steven and I were able to add @ decorators, and use the def__str function to print athlete 1 and athlete 2 and their attributes. | . Init attribute . &quot;init&quot; is short for initialization the process of setting up the environment or initial state of a program or system before it begins to execute. | In object-oriented programming, it often refers to the constructor method of a class, which is called when a new instance of the class is created, and is responsible for setting up the initial state of the object. | In other contexts, an &quot;init&quot; function or script is used to set up a specific environment or configuration for a program to run. | . | . Self Attribute . When a method is called on an object, the first argument passed to the method is the object itself.

Tester . A tester method in programming is a specific test case that is written to test a specific method or function of a software. | It is used to check that a specific functionality of the software behaves as expected and that it meets the requirements and specifications defined in the design phase. | . | . Tester example code: . import unittest class MyClass: def my_method(self, a, b): return a * b class TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase): def setUp(self): self.my_object = MyClass() def test_my_method(self): result = self.my_object.my_method(2, 5) self.assertEqual(result, 10) def test_my_method_negative(self): result = self.my_object.my_method(-2, -5) self.assertEqual(result, 10) if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: unittest.main() . In this example, MyClass is a simple class with a single method my_method(a,b) that takes two numbers as input and returns their product. | TestMyClass is a test case class provided by unittest library and it has 2 test functions test_my_method and test_my_method_negative. | setUp() function is called before each test function, it create an instance of MyClass so that we can use it in test functions. | test_my_method() tests the my_method() function of the MyClass class with the input 2,5, it is expected to get the output of 10, so the assertion assertEqual(result, 10) is comparing the result with the expected output. | test_my_method_negative() is testing the same method with the negative inputs and it is also expecting the result to be 10 by using the same assertion. | .",

The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture are called Hailstone Numbers. Examples:Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.&gt; ### Iteration The action or a process of iterating or repeating:such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result. . Undecidable problems . An undecidable problem is one that should give a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs. . Unsolvable problems . An unsolvable problem is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution. . Additional information . A problem posed by L. Collatz in 1937, also called the 3x+1 mapping, 3n+1 problem, Hasse&#39;s algorithm, Kakutani&#39;s problem, Syracuse algorithm, Syracuse problem, Thwaites conjecture, and Ulam&#39;s problem (Lagarias 1985). Thwaites (1996) has offered a £1000 reward for resolving the conjecture. Let a_0 be an integer. Then one form of Collatz problem asks if iterating . always returns to 1 for positive a_0. (If negative numbers are included, there are four known cycles (excluding the trivial 0 cycle): (4, 2, 1), (-2, -1), (-5, -14, -7, -20, -10), and (-17, -50, -25, -74, -37, -110, -55, -164, -82, -41, -122, -61, -182, -91, -272, -136, -68, -34).) . The members of the sequence produced by the Collatz are sometimes known as hailstone numbers. Conway proved that the original Collatz problem has no nontrivial cycles of length &lt;400. Lagarias (1985) showed that there are no nontrivial cycles with length &lt;275000. Conway (1972) also proved that Collatz-type problems can be formally undecidable. Kurtz and Simon (2007) proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is undecidable; unfortunately, this proof cannot be applied to the original Collatz problem. . The Collatz algorithm has been tested and found to always reach 1 for all numbers &lt;=19·2^(58) approx 5.48×10^(18) (Oliveira e Silva 2008), improving the earlier results of 10^(15) (Vardi 1991, p. 129) and 5.6×10^(13) (Leavens and Vermeulen 1992). Because of the difficulty in solving this problem, Erdős commented that &quot;mathematics is not yet ready for such problems&quot; (Lagarias 1985). . The numbers of steps required for the algorithm to reach 1 for a_0=1, 2, ... are 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 8, 16, 3, 19, 6, 14, 9, 9, 17, 17, 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, ... (OEIS A006577; illustrated above). Of these, the numbers of tripling steps are 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, ... (OEIS A006667), and the number of halving steps are 0, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 3, 13, ... (OEIS A006666). The smallest starting values of a_0 that yields a Collatz sequence containing n=1, 2, ... are 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 12, 7, 9, 15, 3, 7, 18, 19, ... (OEIS A070167). . The Collatz problem can be implemented as an 8-register machine (Wolfram 2002, p. 100), quasi-cellular automaton (Cloney et al. 1987, Bruschi 2005), or 6-color one-dimensional quasi-cellular automaton with local rules but which wraps first and last digits around (Zeleny). In general, the difficulty in constructing true local-rule cellular automata arises from the necessity of a carry operation when multiplying by 3 which, in the worst case, can extend the entire length of the base-b representation of digits (and thus require propagating information at faster than the CA&#39;s speed of light). . More information . Hacks/Assignment . Take the two codes above and combine them so one imput gives the output that contains both the hailstone numbers and the number of iterations it takes i = 1. The more efficient the code, the higher your grade will be. (Algorithm Efficency) (.25) . Unit 3, Section 17: Algorithm Efficiency - Kush &amp; Yasha . What is Algorithm Efficiency? . Yasha - Algorithmic efficiency is an aspect of algorithmic programming that measures the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For instance, If I wanted to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers the numbers [2,4,5,1,3]from least to greatest, rather than having an algorithm that compares itself to the next number and swaps accordingly it would be more efficient if you had a program that scans through all the numbers and checks whether a number is smaller or bigger than the rest than and sorts accordingly. Both of the algorithms had the same objective, but one runs more efficiently than the other. . Here is an example of an inefficient algorithm: . def inefficientWay(numbers): # Then it loops over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # Now it finds the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # Then it swaps the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(inefficientWay([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - This algorithm is inefficent because it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. This is an inefficient way to sort a list. . Kush - Here is an efficent way to sort a list: . def efficient_sort(numbers): # loop over the numbers for i in range(len(numbers)): # find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list min_index = i for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)): if numbers[j] &lt; numbers[min_index]: min_index = j # swap the minimum number with the first unsorted number numbers[i], numbers[min_index] = numbers[min_index], numbers[i] # return the sorted list return numbers # test the algorithm print(efficient_sort([2, 4, 5, 1, 3])) # should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Yasha - The difference in this algorithm is that it uses a loop to find the minimum number in the unsorted part of the list and then swaps it with the first unsorted number. . How can you use algorithms to better your life: Mini activity . Yasha - Just for a second, think about all the tasks in your life that would work so much better automated. The sky&#39;s the limit. For an activity, write down or take a mental note of a task that you encounter in your day to day life, and think of ways where you can automate that task. An example of this would be me creating an algorithm for my morning routine. . tasks = [&quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;eat breakfast&quot;, &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;go to school&quot;] def complete_tasks(tasks): for task in tasks: # code to complete each task goes here if task == &quot;wake up&quot;: print(&quot;Waking up now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;eat breakfast&quot;: print(&quot;Eating breakfast now!&quot;) elif task == &quot;go to school&quot;: print(&quot;Going to school now!&quot;) # and so on for each task in the list # call the function to complete the tasks complete_tasks(tasks) . Waking up now! Eating breakfast now! Going to school now! . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P1 . Kush - Sometimes when a problem has too many possibilities, a heuristic approach would be taken. let&#39;s use planes as an example. Imagine you were a musician on tour. You have shows in New Zealand, United States, Canada, and Russia. Well, what would be the shortest flight route so you can arrive at those destinations as fast as possible? You start in the United States. . Taking a heuristic approach to problems P2 . Kush - Well, since there are multiple possibilities, I chose to pick the countries closest to each other. The reason I chose this algorithm in particular is that it made the most sense. I had to start at United States, but then I went on to Canada, Russia, New Zealand, and then back to the United States. . Visual Representation . Hacks/assignment .

            "content": "Notes . Unsolvable vs undecidable . Unsolvable: is that no algorithm can be written to get the answer to it | Undecidable: There is no code that can find the answer, because it is too complext, but there is an answer. | .

Collatz Conjecture . one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. it asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. | . | . Hailstone numbers . The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture Examples: Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No. | Code terminates at 1. | . | .

Write one algorithm that is efficient and one that is inefficient. Compare them and explain why one is and why one isn’t efficient. . . As you can see, I have coded 2 algorithms that find the factorial of 8. The first one is clearly way more efficient since I used the import math library and used the factorial function to find the factorial of 8. On the other hand, the second one manually multiplies 8765432*1 which is clearly way less efficient and more clunky | The first algorithm is not only easier to read and faster to code, it runs much faster (only 0.1 secs) while the less efficient algorithm took 8 times longer (.8 seconds) to run. | Furthermore the first algorithm is certainly less efficent than the first because of its easier readability and faster runtime. | . | . How one algorithm can be more efficient than annother using mathematical and formal reasoning . There are several factors that can contribute to the efficiency of an algorithm. One of the main factors is the time complexity of the algorithm, which is a measure of how long the algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input. An algorithm with a lower time complexity will generally be more efficient than an algorithm with a higher time complexity, because it will take less time to complete for large inputs. | . | The amount of memory that the running of an algorithm uses up is another factor in determining the efficiency of it. Algorithms that use more processing and memory power to run are generally less efficient, especially if there is another algorithm that uses less memory and processing power to achieve the same task. | . Use variables, if statements, and loops to program an algorithm . . This algorithm that I coded tells you whether you should go outside or not based on the inputted temperature outside. | .",

Example . import math math.sqrt(144) . 12.0 . import math print(&quot;The factorial of 5 is&quot;, math.factorial(5)) . The factorial of 5 is 120 . Review Questions (Answer for candy!) . . 1) In your own words, what is a library? . 2) Why are libraries useful when writing a program? . 3) What keyword is used to add a pre-made library? . Hacks . Write a program that uses a library/libraries in any sort of manner. | Explain your work/code | . . . Lesson 3.15.1 . What is randomization? . 1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those. . 2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us. . Now for a piece of candy does anyone want to tell us an example of randomization during our day to day life. . 3) In order to use the random function we have to first import random at the very beggining. . Now lets look at the code below right here. . import random answer1 = random.randint(0,3) answer2 = random.randint(1,8) answer3 = answer1 + answer2 print(answer3) . 10 . 1) The lowest number that will be generated is 0 for answer 1 and for answer2, the lowest that will be generated is 1 so the lowest number that can be generated for answer 3 would be 1. . 2) The highest number that will be generated to answer1 is 3 and the highest number that will be generated for answer 2 is 8 so the highest number for answer 3 would be 11. . 3) The range of numbers that answer 3 could print out would be from 1 to 11. . So a normal dice contains six sides with 1-6 on the individual sides. Which of the following code would simulate the result of rolling the dice three times and adds together all the obtained values together? . A. . import random sum = random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) + random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . B. . import random sum = random.randint(1,18) print(sum) . 17 . C. . import random sum = 3*random.randint(1,6) print(sum) . 12 . 1) Its not B because B is saying that it is going to choose one number between the range of 1 and 18 and not the sum of 3 diff numbers. . 2) C is not correct also because C is saying that the computer is choosing one random between 1 and 6 and multiplying that 3 times but we want the sum of three different numbers between 1 and 6. . 3) So the answer is A. . . For the last example: . import random i = 1 while i &lt; 4: choose = random.randint(1,10) print(choose) i += 1 . 6 9 8 . Which answers could not be possible for the code above? . A. 4 7 6 . B. 9 1 8 . C. 2 11 5 . D. 5 10 2 . Random can also have different methods, in the above examples we only used one example, randint which returns a random number between the given range. Down below I have created a table of all the methods with the description of what it is used for with the random function. . Method | Description . seed() | Initialize the random number generator . getstate() | Returns the current internal state of the random number generator . setstate() | Restores the internal state of the random number generator . getrandbits() | Returns a number representing the random bits . randrange() | Returns a random number between the given range . randint() | Returns a random number between the given range . choice() | Returns a random element from the given sequence . choices() | Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence . shuffle() | Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order . sample() | Returns a given sample of a sequence . random() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 . uniform() | Returns a random float number between two given parameters . betavariate() | Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics) . expovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics) . gammavariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics) . gauss() | Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories) . lognormvariate() | Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories) . normalvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories) . vonmisesvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics) . paretovariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories) . weibullvariate() | Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics) . Lesson Recap: 1) random function generates a random number from a to b (range of two numbers) . 2) You need to import random in order to use the random function . 3) Every result from an import function is equally likely to occur . Hacks for lesson 3.15.1 . Write a few lines of code that implements the import function . | Define what an import random function do . | List a few other things that we can import other than random . | . . . 3.15.2 Lesson . Some Essential Knowledge that you need to know | RANDOM (a,b) will provide you with a random integer between the numbers a-b | Ex. RANDOM (7,18) can provide you with the number 13. | Using a random generator means each result can come out as different. | . Lets Try an Example Scenario . Try and formulate a way to write a segment of code that can simulate the flipping of a coin. | You have to use a random generator and assign the output of &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot; to a specified result. | . import random coin = random.randint(0,1) if coin == 0: print(&quot;Heads&quot;) if coin == 1: print(&quot;Tails&quot;) . Heads . This is a pretty simple code to understand. | First we use the randomization here between the 1 and 2 to determine which side of the coin we get. | If we get 1 then we get heads. If we get 2 or anything else than 2, then we get Tails. | . Now let&#39;s answer questions using your knowledge. . If you want yes to show up 50% of the time, which of the code segments can you use? | . random(1,100) &lt;= 50 random(1,100) == 50 random(1,10) &lt;= 5 random(1,10) &gt;= 5 . The answer is A,C, and D! | . Why isn&#39;t the answer B? . This because when you are saying equal to 50, you are saying only when this one number shows up the output will be yes. | You want it to come up 50 percent of the time not just when that one number shows up. | . Hacks 3.15.2 . For your hacks you need to create a random number generator that will simulate this situation: | There is a spinner divided into eight equal parts. 3 parts of the spinner are green, two parts are blue, one part is purple, one part is red, and one part is orange. How can you simulate this situation using a random number generator. . | Also answer this question: What numbers can be outputted from RANDOM(12,20) and what numbers are excluded? . | . import random spinner = random.randint(1,8) if spinner &lt;= 3: print(&quot;green&quot;) if spinner &lt;=5: print(&quot;blue&quot;) if spinner == 6: print(&quot;purple&quot;) if spinner == 7: print(&quot;red&quot;) if spinner == 8: print(&quot;orange&quot;) . orange .

Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) .

Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. .

Cube: None Cube: None . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } compare(1,5) . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; . x=49 import math def sqrt(x): squareroot = x ** 0.5 return squareroot squareroot = sqrt(x) print(&quot;sqrt of &quot;, x, &quot;= &quot;, squareroot) . sqrt of 49 = 7.0 .

            "content": "Notes . Understanding Procedures . A procedure is a set of instructions that is given a name which takes in parameters to return values also called methods and functions | Sequencing, selection, and iteration are procedures | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result Allows procredure to run without knowing the specific input values. | . | . . As you an see, this procedure is named “multiply” its parameters are “x” and “y” and returns “The product of 5 times 3 is 15 | . Calling Procedures . You call a procedure by putting the name of ot follwed by paranthesis with the parameters. Ex: def math(x) | . | . Determining the result of a procedure . Follow the code line by line to see what eaach line does | Use syntax to determine function parameters and retunr value and statements. | . | to return the values you write “return” then the expression you want to return that has been defined. . | As you can see this code originally did not have return statement | . . After debugging it with the return statement “return result” we can see the actual output of the function. | . . Managing Complexity . Modularity . the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program Ex: assert “hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5” They would have the same result. Abstraction . | . | . | the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use Duplication . | having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency Logic . | the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Developing Procedures . Parameters store variables and arguments | Call functions with procedure names (syntax in javascript and python) . | Procedure name: the name that was given to a function | Arguments provied info to a functio and are usually defined outside of the function then imported into a function with parameters. | . Python: . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . defines the function with the parameters then prints their sum 1 + 2 is 3 | 2 + 3 is 5 JavaScript: . | . | . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Calls the function with the parameters then adds them together 1 + 2 is 3 | 2 + 3 is 5 | . | . More Parameters . someetimes parameters will provide input to the function . | This function provides 2 parameters and uses them as inputes and calling the function compares the 2 numbers. . | . . Hacks . 3.12 . Procedure and Parameter . Procedure: In an algorithm, it completes a certain task must be called to function | Will take in parameters and will output values. | . | Parameters: Variables that are usually used within procedures. | . Quiz (3/3) . . Return Values and Output Parameters . Return Values: The result of the procedure once it is run | Output Parameters: variables that are used within procedures that can lead to a certain output. | . Code a square root procedure . . 3.13 . Why is abstracting program logic into seperate modular functions effective? . Abstracting a program into seperate modualr functions allows the coder to understand how each part of the code works. If it is a long, complex code it is better to break it down into a greater amount of more simpler modular functions so the program overall is simpler to read. | . Procedure that uses other sub-procedures + explaination . . This program contains three sub-procedures: main(), print_foods(), and add_food(). The main() procedure serves as the entry point for the program, and it calls the other two sub-procedures to perform specific tasks. | The print_foods() procedure takes a list of foods as an argument and prints out each item in the list, while the add_food() procedure prompts the user for a new food to add to the list and then returns that new food. | . | As you can see, I inputted “Falafel” as a food and it added falafel to the list of food. | . Add another layer of abstraction to the word counter . . Procedure Names and Arguments . Procedure names: the names given to a method to produce an output | Arguments: the data that is inputted into the function for example: | . Code of Procedures, Arguments, and Parameters (interactive with HTML and JavaScript) . Here is an example of a calculator that uses arguments and parameters with Script and HTML. . | Write an expression using “+, -, /, or *” between TWO numbers and press calculate | For example: 3*3 would output 9. | . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; .

            "content": "Unit 3.9 . 3.9.1 Algorithms (Claire) . A little review on Algorithms: . what are the three components of an algorithm? . sel__ | seq__ | it___ | . Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Wow! Good job! . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Wow! Good job! . isStudent = False isGPA = True if isStudent == True: print(&quot;You didn&#39;t get into college yet!&quot;) else: if isGPA == True: print(&quot;You got in!&quot;) else: print(&quot;You didn&#39;t win the game yet!&quot;) . You got in! . isStudent = False isGPA = True inCollege = not(isStudent) and isGPA if inCollege == False: print(&quot;You didn&#39;t get into college yet!&quot;) if inCollege == True: print(&quot;You got into college!&quot;) . You got into college! . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Wow! Good job! . Why is this important? . When collaborating or working on group projects, two people might come up with two different ways to solve a problem, and that happens a lot. . know that same goal can be achieved in many ways (the possibilities are endless) | make notes in you code! (explain how it works to others or you future self) | . How to write Nested Conditionals as Boolean expressions . the following 2 pieces of code is supposed to print &quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot; unless: . it is a weekday | . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True #if holiday, dont go to school if isHoliday == True: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) # otherwise, if it is a weekday, go to school else: if isWeekday == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # but if it is neither a weekday or holiday, don&#39;t go to school else: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school&quot;) . go to school! . isHoliday = False isWeekday = True # setting variables here (same as above to make comparison easier) driveSchool = not(isHoliday) and isWeekday if driveSchool == False: print(&quot;don&#39;t go to school!&quot;) if driveSchool == True: print(&quot;go to school!&quot;) # now we can make a regular conditional/ if statement without having a nested conditional . go to school! . Hacks . why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?(0.15) | for the converted conditional to boolean conversion(0.10) | total: 0.25 | . 3.9.2 Developing Algorithms (Annika) . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, its good to outline its process before coding This ensures that it is sequenced correctly | . | You should represent the algorithm using a flowchart or natural language Visualization can help you better see the flow of the whole algorithm | This may allow for the coding process to be more efficient and effective | . | . Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 . Start | The number of pretzels in the pack is 6 | Eat one pretzels, number of pretzels in pack goes down by 1 | How many pretzels are left? | Repeat step 3 until number of pretzels is 0 | Display that pack is empty | Finish | pretzel = 6 while (pretzel &gt; 0): pretzel -= 1 print(pretzel) if pretzel == 0: print(&quot;All done!&quot;) . 5 4 3 2 1 0 All done! . Example 2 . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 &lt;br&gt; 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 &lt;br&gt; 4+ hours: $12 . . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . The parking rate is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 4+ hours: $12 How many hours have you parked at this garage? 4.0 hours costs: $12 Have a good day! . Hacks . Develop your own complex algorithm using a flowchart and natural language, then code it! . Requirements: . Includes both a flowchart AND natural language | Working code of the same algorithm | Incorporates selection AND/OR iteration | Make it creative! | . Tips: . This site is good for making flowcharts! | Natural language should just be a list | Think about the whole process, not just the end result | . isSunny = True temp = 82 if isSunny == True and temp &lt; 70: print(&quot;Wear not warm clothes&quot;) else: if temp &gt; 60: print(&quot;You can go outside&quot;) else: if isSunny == False: bro = input(&quot;is it raining or snowing?&quot;) else: print(&quot;what is the weather like?&quot;) . You can go outside . 3.9.3 Using preexisting algorithms (Grace) . Main Idea . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. . DISPLAY (&quot;Choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT () REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0 ) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- n * 3 + 1 } . Hacks . Fix the number guessing game . Make a flow chart for the algorithm number guessing game | Make a function that gets the user guess | Modify the existing search function to give more encouraging feedback | import random #sets variables for the game num_guesses = 0 user_guess = 0 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 #generates a random number number = random.randint(1,100) # print(number) #for testing purposes print(f&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100.&quot;) #Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input() def guess(): #add something here return #add something here #Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if guess &lt; number: print(&quot;You are bad at guessing&quot;) #change this lower_bound = guess elif guess &gt; number: print(&quot;You suck :(&quot;) #change this upper_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) print(f&quot;Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.&quot;) print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) . import random #sets variables for the game num_guesses = 0 user_guess = -1 upper_bound = 100 lower_bound = 0 #generates a random number number = random.randint(0,100) # print(number) #for testing purposes print(f&quot;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 0 and 100.&quot;) #Write a function that gets a guess from the user using input() def guess(): num = input(&quot;What number?&quot;) #add something here return num #add something here #Change the print statements to give feedback on whether the player guessed too high or too low def search(number, guess): global lower_bound, upper_bound if int(guess) &lt; int(number): print(&quot;too low, try again&quot;) #change this lower_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound elif int(guess) &gt; int(number): print(&quot;Too high, try again&quot;) #change this upper_bound = guess return lower_bound, upper_bound else: upper_bound, lower_bound = guess, guess return lower_bound, upper_bound while user_guess != number: user_guess = guess() num_guesses += 1 print(f&quot;You guessed {user_guess}.&quot;) lower_bound, upper_bound = search(number, user_guess) if int(upper_bound) == int(number): break else: print(f&quot;Guess a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.&quot;) print(f&quot;You guessed the number in {num_guesses} guesses!&quot;) .

Steps: . first put the numbers in order ascending | descending | . | find the middle number first this is found by taking the highest index number plus the lowest index number and divide by 2 | the numbers on the right will be greater and the numbers on the left will be smaller | this can be represented with a binary tree middle number with the smaller number branched off on the left and bigger numbers branched off on the right | . | . | these lists are not always numbers lists can be made with strings | ex. [“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “peach”, “watermelon”] | alphabetical order a-z | . | . | . Hacks . Algorithms . why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?(0.15) It is important to understand that similar algorithms have different results, because it is good to know that there are different ways to accomplish the same task. | Programs can also have similar looking codes but have different outputs. This is important to know when you troubleshoot code to find out what is wrong. | . | . . As you can see these codes that I made are extremely similar and serve a very similar purpose, but they have slight differences. | . Make an algorithm with natural language, a flow chart, and code. Should use Selection or iteration. . Natural Language: . It is Sunny | If it is below 70 degrees wear not warm clothes | Else, you can go outside | If it is not false ask if it is raining or snowing | Flow Chart . . Code . . Fix number guessing game and give more encouraging feedback, make flow chart . . . . Calculate middle index and create binary tree, what is the second number? which of the lists cannot be a be a binary search be used to find a targetted value. . Set 1 . Middle index: | . . Flow Chart | . . The second number looked at in a binary search would be 80 | . Set 2 . Middle Index: | . . Flow Chart | . . The second number looked at in a binary search would be 74 | . Set 3 . Middle Index | . . Flow Chart | . . The second number looked at in a binary search would be 96 | . The list that can not use a binary search to find a targeted value is C. [3, 2, 8, 12, 99] because it is unsorted. |",

            "content": "Notes . 3.8 . Iteration . Iteration is a repeating part of an algorithm that repeats a specfied number of times until a condition is met | Iteration statemtns change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met | . Example: . Trying to find a lost item Determine what the item is | Ask every family member/friend who would see it Stop condition: If you find it go to step 5 | . | make a full sweep of everywhere you have Stop Condition: If you find it go to step 5 | . | Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the item is found | If never find it: Go Back to your room and cry | If you find item: enjoy the item | . | Example in code | . . Result of Iteration Statements . When using a range function, the last number in the input is not included in the output. Starting value: The number that the range function will start with | Incrementing: The number in which the range increments by | Ending value: The final number of the range. | . | . Loops . While loops use a condition then print something based on a condition. This example prints all even numbers less than 10. | . | . . the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. | Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. | . 3.10 . Lists . the process of visiting each element in a list in a sequential order. Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed - Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed | Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time. | . | Traversing allows you to access or search for certain elements | . College Board Lists . insert( ) allows a value to be inserted into a list at index i | append( ) allows a value to be added at the end of a list | remove( ) allows an element at index i to be deleted from a list | length( ) returns the number of elements currently in a specific list | . Here is an example question . . The answers would be B and D, because they value the responsies rather than the animals | . . The loop above allows the coder to access each item within the list | . Hacks . Iteration . Define an Iteration Iteration is a repeating part of an algorithm that repeats a specfied number of times until a condition is met | . | Make your own example of an iteration with at least 4 steps and a stopping condition(Similar to mine that I did) Hypothetically there are 8 people named Liav (1-8) | Each person will say that their name is Liav until they get to the person who’s name is not Liav. | Each time the next “Liav” comes the number increases by one | Stop using a break function when you get to the person not named Liav (6) | . | Program a simple iteration. | . This iteration would have repeated Hi, my name is Liav! 8 times, but I added a break at 6 that prints “your name isnt Liav Anymore” | . Iteration Statements . What is an iteration statement, in your own words? Iteration statemtn repeat statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met. | . | Create a descending list of numbers using for loop | . Using while loop, make a list of numbers which will form an output of 3,16,29,42,55,68,81 | . Find the Lowest Value . . Variable that holds the minimum and sets it to potential minimm value loop check and displays the minimum value. | . Quiz . . A few notes on reference sheet . aList[i] accesses the eleement of aList at index i the dirst element of aList is at index 1 and is accessed using the notation aList[1] | x &lt;– aList[i] assigns the value of aList[i] to the variable given (x in this case) | Append (aList, value) increases the lenght of aList by 1 at the end of a list | Insert/Remove shifts the position to the right (increase) or shifts the position to the left (decrease) Insert increases the value of the list by 1 | Remove decreases the value of the list by 1 | . | .",

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board’s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than another. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as “containers” and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of “Alex.” How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named “age” becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone’s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board’s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone’s dog’s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone’s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable’s value | What function is used to recieve a user’s input? | Hacks . As your code becomes increasingly more complex, variables and their names will make reading and fixing your code easier. | . Create code that… . Uses variables | Show your understanding of different variable data types by using at least 2 different types in your code | Uses meaningful names to prevent confusion | . Rubric 0.2/0.2 . Code needs to function | Data types are properly used for their given function | Each variable has identification to prevent confusion | Each Variable is utilized for their intended purpose | . Variables (3.1.2) - Noor . Learning objective for 3.1.2: . Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment . done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator | . Note: . Collegeboard uses &lt;– as the assignment operator . The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let’s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . . JavaScript Example . Let’s get a little more practical here . Imagine that you are making a calendar and have just finished the html code that is needed: . You now want to be able to switch between the months of the year by using the “next” or “prev” buttons you will need to take the html elements and use them to your advantage but how? | . | . | . . Recap: . We learned what is a assignment operator | We learned how to use the assignment operator | We learned how to store a value inside a variable using the assignment operator | We experimented with a few examples | . Hacks: . Answer these: . In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? | . Hacks: . Copy the all the html code into a markdown file and run your local server. You will then see a decimal to binary converter near the html code. The problem is that it is not converting the decimal to binary. This is because the variables are not defined properly and it is your job to use the information learned today to fix the converter. Don’t change the css . Bonus (optional): . There’s more than one way to define the variable. List two ways to do it. . Rubric . For .15: . Student has followed directions properly and has the converter working | . For .18: . Student has completed some of the bonus material alongside requirement for 2.7 | . For .20: . Student has completed all of the material, answered thoughtfully, and met requirements for 2.7 | . 3.2.1 List and Strings Using Variables- Nathan . Strings . Strings is a series of characters (numbers, letters, etc), one example of a string is your name or your id because strings can contain both numbers and letters. . The following are all examples of strings being used in code, in this case, within print functions. . . Lists . Lists are sequences of elements with each element being a variable. An example of a list can be the names of the students in this classroom. . Features of Lists . The elements within the list can be accessed by index. | Can store various elements | The list is in order | . Example of a list and how it can be used . . List Index . An index is an element of a string. Indices typically start with 0, but Collegeboard has the index start at 1. . . Hacks . Questions . What is a list? | What is an element | What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string? | What is an example of a string? | . Create an index of your favorite foods . Tips: Index starts at 1, Strings are ordered sequences of characters . Extra work: Try to create an index that lists your favorite food and print the element at index 3. More work: Create a list of your favorite foods and create an index to access them. . marks = [“food1”] . Rubric . . 3.2.2 Data Abstraction with Lists - Steven . Data abstraction can be created with lists. . Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction). . . Hacks . The following code is incomplete. Its intended purpose is to increase three numbers, all of which ask for user input, by an amount specified the user. The input code is abstracted, but the actual logic isn’t connected to the abstraction. | . . The following provides a rubric for my hacks (scored out of 0.20) . 0.20 - Fully functioning data abstraction with a list 0.10 - not functioning, but attempt at making a list 0.00 - not functioning, no evidence of attempt based upon the guidelines . 3.2.3 Managing Complexity with lists - Liav . Long and slow way . By now, everyone should know the “long and slow way” to print a list of something in python It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable | This method is displayed in this example with test scores: | . | . . As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as “score1 = 95” and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient… | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets “[]” to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don’t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | . Python Quiz . Now everyone should take this short python quiz and screenshot your score. | . . Simplify Foods List . Now simplify this foods list using what you have learned | . . Hacks . On a single markdown file: Insert a screenshot of your score on the python quiz | Insert a screenshot of your simplifying of the food list | Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code? | Make your own list the “long and slow way” then manage the complexity of the list | . | . Rubric . In ordere to earn a .20/.20 you must On a markdown post: | make an attempt at the python quiz | Successfully simplify the food list | Answer the question in detail | Provide evidence of your own list that you coded | . | .",

As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as “score1 = 95” and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient… | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets “[]” to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don’t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | .

My group contains 5 members: Noor, Ederick, Steven, Nathan, and Myself. | We are presenting Unit 3 lessons 1-2, and since those 2 lessons are split into 5 sections, each of us is responsible for presenting one of the sections I recieved Unit 3 lesson 2 section 3. | . | Each of us will develop our own presentation, follow along jupyter notebook, non-lecture stuff, and hacks/HW for our portion . | The group will each make their lesson and hacks on individual markdown posts, then we will combine these into one master post that we will present to the class We will also convert this master markdown into a Jupyter notebook that will include coding practice and debugging that our classmates will follow along with our lesson. | . | Since our topics (Variables, Assignments, and Data Abstraction) are quite short and simple, each group member will “lecture” for a very short amount of time before giving the class a task, because they most likely already know how to do our topic. | . Lesson Plan . My group members previously went over variables and how to make lists and strings, so it is my job to make examples. | Mention and go over this reference sheet for making lists with values, aLists, and Blists: | . . After this I will pause and ask the class to complete a python quiz that will be in the jupyter notebook. Questions in this quiz would include: The purpose of lists and dictionaries are to manage the _____ of a program (Complexity) | Lists are a form of data __ (abstraction) | . | Part of the Hacks will be screenshotting their answers to this quiz. | . | Explan how using a list is a good way to simplify a code segment For example I just make a new line for each name like: Name1 = John (break) Name2 = Jake (break) … A way to simplify this is Names = [John, Jake, …] | . | . | Here I will have a debug segment in the jupyter notebook: A list will be displayed the “long and slow way” by typing out each individual variable (such as the one above with the names) then the class will be tasked to manage the complexity of this list. | . | . Hacks/Homework . On a Markdown: . Insert a screenshot of your score on the python quiz | Insert a screenshot of your debuging of the list | Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code? | Make your own list the “long and slow way” then manage the complexity of the list | .",

Computer Science Projects . Striver . . The first CS project I visited was from MORT Period 4 CSP. | They created Striver, a program that acts as a social media website for thoughts and quotes.

You can see this images tracks the stock price of a GOOGL stock price. | . Arts Projects . Graphic Design . . The first art project I visited was from a Graphic Design class. | After strolling around the graphic design area, this was the piece that caught my eye the most. | I love the way that it contrasts the light and dark setups. | . Art . . The next project I visited was in the art section where I saw this beautifully painted artpiece. | The Dark colors are what originally caught my eye, but after a few seconds of analyzing I could tell that the artists intentions behind the piece were most likely to spread awarness of global warming. | This is a really cool way to merge your personal beliefs with art. | . Ceramics . . Next I found myself in the ceramics section, where there were plenty of well made pieces. | This plate is the piece I liked the most because they got the San Diego Padres Logo and colors perfectly. | Additionally the pumpkin was made perfectly and was extremely detailed. | . Digital Media Production . . Finally, I concluded night at the museum by watching this individual’s PSA, where he talked about Food Waste. | He had many very interesting facts about the harm that Food Waste is bringing on our world, and made a very lasting impact on his listener to prevent themselves from wasting food. | . Overall Thoughts .

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

All computing devices work together in a network | Computer devices are physical aritfacts that can run a progra, Like servers, routers, computers, and tablets | . | Computing system is a group of computing devices and programs that work together for a common purpose | A computer network is a group of computing devices that send and recive data. A type of computer network | A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network | Message file is broken up into packets and sent through various paths (that can include a router) into the reciever. | . | A path between 2 computing devices in a network is a sequence of a sending computer device and a reciever. | routing is finding a path between sender and reciever | Bandwidth of a computer netweork is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. Bandwidth is measured in bits per second. | . | . 4.1.2 Notes . Computer networks facilitate the transfer of data | How the internet works The internet is a computer network consinting of interconnected networks tha tuse standardized, non-proprieary communication ports | Access to the internet depends on the abilitty to connect a computing device to an internet connected device. | . | Data is sent through internet via packets Information is passed through the internet as a data stream Chunks of data encapsulated in packets | . | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the Packet between tge origin and te destination | Packets can arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all | IP, TCP, UDP are common protocls used on the internet | . | Difference between internet and World wide Web The world wide web is a system of linked pages programs and files | HTTP is a protocol used on the WWW | The WWW uses the internet. | . | Protocols are an agreed upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system THe protocols in the internet are open and allows users to easily connect additional computing devices. | . | Routing on the internet is dynamic | The scalability of a system is the capacity for it to change in size and scales to meet new demands internet was designed to be scaleable. | . | . . . . . . 4.1 The Internet Quiz . . Question 1 . . We learned from the video that messages are generally transmitted over the internet by breaking them into numerous packets that reach the reciever through various tracks/courses. | . Question 2 . . Open products are sets of rules that specify the behavior of the system, and are generally agreed upon and followed. These are used used on the internet so we can standardize data transmision over multiple devices. | . Question 3 . . The WWW and internet are different, since the WWW is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that are accessed from the network that is the internet. THe Internet is the network that the WWW uses be accessed. | .",

            "content": "“Psychology and the Good Life” Notes/Insight . Summary . In this video, Laurie Santos talked about her class “Psychology and the Good Life”. Laurie Santos is a professor at Yale and she thought that instead of only teaching how human minds work, she needed to teach students how to implement the new knowledge to make their lives happier. So she made the class, “Psychology and the Good Life”, and in her talk she summed up the class with ten insights. . Instight #1: Material and temporary joy does not affect one’s happiness in the long-term . When people want to get happier, they believe that they must get rid of the bad things in their life or get more money from their jobs. Though this does slightly affect one’s well-being, it only affects at most 10% of it. Found in a study by Sonja Lyubomirsky, behaviors and willingness to change is what takes the most effect on one’s well-being. . Instight #2: We can change our well-being . There is a common misconception that we are stuck in the current well-being we are in, but that is false. We are able to improve our happiness ourselves. From a study by Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist, found that about 50% of our well-being is affected by our genes. This means that the other 50% can be affected by our own doing. . Instight #3: Bringing your self is the hardest part of changing your well-being . Taking control of your flow of life is the hardest part of becoming happy. Just learning about psychology won’t help you become happy, you must put it into practice. For example to become fit, one must workout regularly and consistently to observe results. Same with your well-being, one must make a change that is consistently affecting your life for the better. . Instight #:4 Realize that your intuition is lying to yourself about how to become happy . Your mind is not telling you what you need to become happy. To become happy, one must realize that their mind is not telling the truth. Your mind tells you that you need more material possessions to be happy, but this is false because one you get those items, you just want more. . Instight #5: Social connections are key for happiness . Nick Eppley and his colleagues at Chicago Business School conducted a study asking people on the subway to stay in a solitary state, a state where one must talk to another the whole ride, or do what ever they want. According to the study, the people who made social connections felt happier than before and those who were solitary felt worse. . Insight #6: Be present in the moment . Taking time to realize what you are doing and focusing is important for your well-being. People tend to just go through the motions and rush through the day trying to get everything done, but taking a moment to really comprehend what is going on in your day can bump up your well-being. . Insight #7: Make time to be gratuitous everyday . Taking time to be thankful about something everyday can improve one’s happiness. Just writing a small note about what you are grateful for can bump up your happiness and well-being. It keeps your mind on positivity instead of negativity and it is good for your well-being. . Gratitude Note . Note to my good friend, Martin Nguyen: . Marty, you are such a beast. Even though we just met at the beginning of last school year, I am so glad that we are this good of friends now. I love everytime we go to 4s and ball on kids, and am looking forward to many more appearences by the dynamic duo, Marty and Lave. I know you are going to do big things, and can’t wait to finish high school together. | . Martins Response . Liav you are such a bear. Your one of the toughest people I know and you always find another way of doing things even when life knocks you down. I greatly appreciate you for the note and I am thankful for our friendship for the past year. Can’t wait to finish high school. | . List of Gratitude .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

(This was my groups presentation) | . 3.3-3.4 . 3.3 . an Algorithm is a set of instruction that accomplish a task . Sequencing . The order of how you do something | Like the instructions of a teacher and howo you follow them | . Selection . Allows the algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met Go to the gas station if your tank is empty, dont if its full. | . | . Iteration . A loop that does something over and over again until a condition is met | . Mathematical Expressions . Sequential statements specify how signals are assigned and the process that is executed as a whole. Execute in the order in which they appear | . | . Examples of arithmetic operators: . -Addition: a+b -Subtraction: a-b -Multiplication: a*b -Division: a/b -Modulus: a MOD b (a and b can be string or number) . Modulus operator divides the given numeratior by the denominatior to find the result. . The syntax is %. | . Strings . String concatenation joins two or more strings end to end to make a new string | . Examples of strings in pseudocode: . len (str) returns the number of character is str | len(“hello”) returns 5 | . | concat (str1, str2) returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str 2 | concat(“hello”,”world”) return ‘hello world’ | . | substring (str1, str2, length) returns a substring of consecutive character from str1, starting the character at position ‘start’ and containing ‘length’ character | substring (“hello”,”world”, 4,5) returns ‘lo wor’ | . | .

A loop that does something over and over again until a condition is met | Was #4 on the image | . 3.5 - 3.7 . What is Boolean . Denotating system of algorithmic notation in computing or electronics Boolean examples are either true or false Example: Sky is blue - True | . | . | . Relational operators . The mathmatical relationship between two variables | Determines an output on whether or not the statement is true | a=b, a&gt;b, etc. | . Logical Operators . NOT displays the opposite of whatever the data is usually used for true/false | . | . . AND is used to evaluate 2 conditoons together to determine of both conditions are met Example: if grade is above 70 and grade is below 100, you passed the quiz. | . | . . OR, if one of the conditions are met, the function works. | . . Conditionals . Conditionals allow for the expression of algorithms that utilize selection without a programming language. | Writing conditional statements is key to computer science. | Determine the result of conditional statements | . Key Terms . Selection is The specific block of code that will execute depending on the algorithm condition returning true or false. | Algorithm is “A finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.” | Conditional Statement / If-Statement is a statement that affects the sequence of control by executing certain statements depending on the value of a boolean. . | Conditional statements (“if” statements) affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression. The exam reference sheet provides: . | In which the code in block of statements is executed if the Boolean expression condition evaluates to true; no action is taken if condition evaluates to false | . Nested Conditionals . Conditional statments within a conditional statement example: an else if inside of another else-if | Can be used for a varying amount of “else if statements.” The first if statement can represent if two coditions are true. The first else if can represent if only one or the other is true. The last else if represents if neither of the conditions are true. | Can have three different conditions | . | . . 3.8 - 3.10 . Iteration . Iteration is a repeating part of an algorithm that repeats a specfied number of times until a condition is met | Iteration statemtns change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met | . Example: . Trying to find a lost item Determine what the item is | Ask every family member/friend who would see it Stop condition: If you find it go to step 5 | . | make a full sweep of everywhere you have Stop Condition: If you find it go to step 5 | . | Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the item is found | If never find it: Go Back to your room and cry | If you find item: enjoy the item | . | Example in code | . . Result of Iteration Statements . When using a range function, the last number in the input is not included in the output. Starting value: The number that the range function will start with | Incrementing: The number in which the range increments by | Ending value: The final number of the range. | . | . Loops . While loops use a condition then print something based on a condition. This example prints all even numbers less than 10. | . | . . the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. | Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. | . 3.10 . Lists . the process of visiting each element in a list in a sequential order. Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed - Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed | Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time. | . | Traversing allows you to access or search for certain elements | . College Board Lists . insert( ) allows a value to be inserted into a list at index i | append( ) allows a value to be added at the end of a list | remove( ) allows an element at index i to be deleted from a list | length( ) returns the number of elements currently in a specific list | . Here is an example question . . The answers would be B and D, because they value the responsies rather than the animals | . . The loop above allows the coder to access each item within the list | . 3.9 - 3.11 . Algorithms Review . Three components of an algorithm are: Selection | Sequence | Iteration | . | Different algorithms can be used to achieve the same result | Algorithms that look the same can also have different results | . . . As you can see these are slightly different codes, but since I inputed the same grade (93 NOT 90 lol) for both, I recivied the same result. . | Its kind of like debugging how very small changes in similar algorithms can make durastic differences. . | Can help display to future self or other people what each part of the code does. . | . Nested Conditional statements . . This nested conditional displays an algorithm that tells you whether you should go to school or not depending on the day of the week. | . Developing Algorithms . Outline the process of the code first so you ensure that it is sequenced correctly Its good to make a flowchart to visualize all the steps of the process | Makes the coding process more effective. | Start off with doing it in natural lingo, rather than a flow chart. | . | Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example . The parking rate for a garage is as follows: Less than one hour: Free 1-2 hours: $5 2-3 hours: $8 3-4 hours: $10 4+ hours: $12 . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | . I inputted “4 hours parked” and the algorithm determined that my parking would cost $12. | . Using preexisting algorithms . Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors You don’t need to code everything from the ground up. | . | Modifying the preexisting code, you can develop on it and make a better code. | . Binary Search . Steps: . first put the numbers in order ascending | descending | . | find the middle number first this is found by taking the highest index number plus the lowest index number and divide by 2 | the numbers on the right will be greater and the numbers on the left will be smaller | this can be represented with a binary tree middle number with the smaller number branched off on the left and bigger numbers branched off on the right | . | . | these lists are not always numbers lists can be made with strings | ex. [“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “peach”, “watermelon”] | alphabetical order a-z | . | . | .",
