  <li>My grading was very similar to college board, for the most part, however for Managing complexity, I did not see that their list was not essential for their program to function, which is why I gave them an undeserved point. Return statements and strings would give them the same result as making it into a list, so there is really no functionality of it.</li>

  <li>This one was much easier to grade, because it was a clear 6/6. They were spot on for every requirement and explained/coded everything in absolute detail, so it checked all the boxes.</li>
  <li>I will save this for reference in the future, however I understand that Mr. Mort expects more from us than that.</li>

<p>Row 1: Program Purpose and Function</p>
<ul>
  <li>[] Demonstrates an input, output, and program functionality</li>
  <li>[] Written Response describes the purpose, functionality, and input/output of the program</li>
  <li>[] Point?</li>
</ul>

<p>Row 2: Data Abstraction</p>
<ul>
  <li>[] Includes two program segments: 1. that shows how data has been stored in a list. 2. that shows the data in the same list used to fulfill the program purpose</li>
  <li>[] Identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used</li>
  <li>[] Describes what data in the list is representing the program</li>
  <li>[] Point?</li>
</ul>

<p>Row 3: Managing Complexity</p>
<ul>
  <li>[] Includes a code segment that shows a list that manages the complexity of the program</li>
  <li>[] Explains how this list manages the complexity and explains why the program would work differently or not at all without this list.</li>
  <li>[] Point?</li>
</ul>

<p>Row 4: Procedural Abstraction</p>
<ul>
  <li>[] Includes two program code segments: 1. showing a student developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the procedure. 2. one shows where the procedure is being called</li>
  <li>[]  Describes what this procedure does and how it contributes to the functionality of the program</li>
  <li>[] Point?</li>
</ul>

<p>Row 5: Algorithm Implementation</p>
<ul>
  <li>[] Includes a program code segment of an algorithm that has sequencing, iteration, and selection</li>
  <li>[] explains in detail how the algorithm works, with enough detail that someone could recreate it.</li>
  <li>[] Point?</li>
</ul>

<p>Row 6: Testing</p>
<ul>
  <li>[] Describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3.c Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.</li>
  <li>[] Describes the conditions tested by each call to the procedure</li>
  <li>[] Identifies the result of each call</li>
  <li>[] Point?</li>
