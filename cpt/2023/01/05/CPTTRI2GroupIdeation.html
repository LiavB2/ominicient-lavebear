<ul>
  <li>We plan on making a convienient exercise tracker web-app. We will do this by implementing wearable integration, user personalization, goal setting, weather-based activity suggestions, meal planning, and exercise tracking.
    <ul>
      <li>user personalization: This will include exercise suggestions based on the users height, weight, BMI, age, and gender.</li>
      <li>goal setting: This will include the user to prompt realistic goals for themselves in order to improve</li>
      <li>Weather-based activity suggestions: This will be made through a weather api. For example, if the weather api sends the data back to the caller and the data says that today will be a rainy day, then the suggestion will be to do a home workout.</li>
      <li>meal planning: based on the users personalized data. User will be categorized into bulk, cut, or maingain and will be given the meal suggestions based on this.</li>
      <li>Exercise tracking: This will track the users exercise activity. It will have a database of a lot of exercises and their average calories burned/min, and other info.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="agile-manifesto">
<a class="anchor" href="#agile-manifesto" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agile Manifesto</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Here is our team manifesto:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Create a project that satisfies the teachers expectations and the developers</li>
  <li>Have a product that goes above and beyond the project criteria and is beneficial to others</li>

  <li>We will respect each others time and commitment and strive to be reliable and meet the deadlines on time</li>
  <li>Support and encourage each others personal and professional growth</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="how-will-we-use-sass">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-will-we-use-sass" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How will we use SASS?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Our main usage for SASS will be to modularize our code by making use of the import function in SASS</li>
</ul>
