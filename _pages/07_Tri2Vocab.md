# Vocab We Have Covered in Lessons
- Managing complexity, algorithms, sequencing, selection, iteration, Booleans, If Elif and Else Conditionals, Nested Conditionals, For and While loops.

## Managing Complexity in Lists

- Assinging lists to one variable rather than a different variable per value. As shown here in this example I coded:

## Alorithms
 - A set of instructions that are followed in order to accomplish a task
 - Example of an algorithm below:

### Sequencing


### Selection


### Iteration
- A repeating portion of an algorithm that repeats a certain amount of times until a condition is met
- Example of iteration:

### If Elif and Else Conditionals


### Nested Conditionals


## Loops

### For Loops
- Used for definite loops with a finite number of iterations. Used for when you know exactly the amount of times you want it to repeat.

### While Loops
- Used for loops with an infinite/unknown number of iterations. Runs until a condition is met.
