    "- What is a database schema?\n",
    "    - A database schema is the blueprint or structure of a database. It defines how data is organized and how tables, fields, and relationships are designed within the database. A database schema includes the tables, columns, constraints, relationships, and other elements that define the structure of the database.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?\n",
    "    - An identity column in SQL database is a column that automatically generates a unique numeric value for each row that is added to a table. It is used to uniquely identify each row in the table and can be used as a primary key. Identity columns are often used in conjunction with auto-incrementing values.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "    - The purpose of a primary key in SQL database is to uniquely identify each row in a table. A primary key is a column or set of columns that have a unique value for each row in the table. It is used to enforce data integrity and to create relationships between tables. A primary key can be used to join tables together and to ensure that each row in a table can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "- What are the Data Types in SQL table?\n",
    "    - Numeric data types: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL, etc.\n",
    "    - Character and string data types: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT, etc.\n",
    "    - Date and time data types: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, etc.\n",
    "    - Binary data types: BLOB, BINARY, VARBINARY, etc.\n",
    "    - Other data types: BOOLEAN, ENUM, SET, JSON, XML, etc.\n",
    "    - The specific data types available in SQL may vary depending on the database management system being used."

    "- Explain try/except, when would except occur?\n",
    "    - Try and except work as things which check if certain code is running/working. Try runs if the code is working smoothly, and in this case serves to update the password. Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code.\n",
    "- What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?\n",
    "    - Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily."

    "- In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction?\n",
    "    - This implementation has a lot of procedural abstraction. There are functions created in order to be able to define what procedures we want to do in the code. For example, there are procedures defined for create, read, update, and delete. This allows us to have a broad function which can be used to add information to specific rows of the database.\n",

    "        - There is data abstraction in this code. There are many things which are defined when creating a user, from their name to password to date of birth. These all need to be stored together, and using the code, we create a specific uid for the user which allows the rest of the data to be called from. The uid is essential in functions like update and delete, where data is removed or changed based on the user-specific uid.\n",
