    "## Advanced Security Certbot\n",
    "- Certbot is a popular tool used to automate the process of obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates for websites.\n",
    "    -  It works by communicating with the Let's Encrypt certificate authority, which provides free certificates for domain validation. \n",
    "    - Certbot verifies that the domain name is controlled by the user requesting the certificate and then generates and installs the certificate on the user's web server.\n",
    "- Advanced security features of Certbot include the ability to configure HTTPS redirection and to automate the renewal of certificates before they expire. \n",
    "    - HTTPS redirection ensures that all traffic to the website is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and tampering by third parties. \n",
    "    - Certificate renewal ensures that the website's security credentials remain up to date and valid, preventing browser warnings and other security issues.\n",
