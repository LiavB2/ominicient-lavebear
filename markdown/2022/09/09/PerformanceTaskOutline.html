<h2 id="nfl-fantasy-football-team-generator">
<a class="anchor" href="#nfl-fantasy-football-team-generator" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NFL Fantasy Football Team Generator</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start with a home page that welcomes the user to the Fantasy Team Generator and have a button “Click Start to Begin”</li>
  <li>First page will ask what colors they like (List colors that are predominant colors of specific NFL Teams such as Red Chiefs, Black Raiders, Green Packers, Purple Ravens, Blue Titans, Orange Bengals, etc) The color they choose will be assiciated with their base team.</li>
  <li>Every page after this will Display 4 traits of QB, RB, Tight End, WR, CB, S, DL, LB, and one player will be associated with each of the traits. For example for QB the traits will be Scrambler (Russel Wilson), Dual Threat (Lamar Jackson), Gunslinger (Patrick Mahomes), Pocket Passer (Tom Brady). The trait they choose is the player at that position that will be on their fantasy team.</li>
  <li>The last page will display the total fantasy team that they have created. With Images of all the players and the logo of the NFL team that they got.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="program-purpose-and-function">
<a class="anchor" href="#program-purpose-and-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Purpose and Function</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The input of the function will be clicks by the user to answer certain questions, while the output of the function will be a fully developed fantasy football team that includes every position and a base team. The purpose of the program is to make a nice fantasy football team for people who do not know much about football.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The data in this program will be the players that the user selects based on the variables listed (traits). This data will represent the final fantasy football team that will be generated from their decisions. This will not be a repition of the same code, and there will be multiple code segments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Complexity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There will be multiple properties of the program that are not all repitions of the same code to maintain the complexity of the program. Lists from a dictionary of traits and players will be created with multiple code segments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Procedural Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A procedure will be identified in the program (aquiring data from trait decisions) which contributes to the functionalty of the program (making a fantasy football team).This procedure will be named trait abstraction, and there will be multiple parameters such as trait, player, position, and team.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithm Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The algorithm that will be created in this program will be based on the data (traits) that the user chooses. The iteration will be Choose position, choose trait, recieve players, recieve full fantasy team. The selection will be traits of certain postions (based on specific players). This algorithm will be explained in detail once it is created.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The video will display a video of myself completing the generator and creating a fantasy football team through selecting specific traits of every postion. The written description will describe what happened after each selection.</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-i-need-to-learn-before-creating-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I Need to Learn Before Creating This</h1>

<ul>
  <li>How to create algorithms</li>
  <li>How to store data based on selections that the user made.</li>
  <li>How to implement this acquired data into the final output</li>
</ul>
