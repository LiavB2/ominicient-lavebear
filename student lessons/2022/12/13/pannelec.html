<h1 id="qa">
<a class="anchor" href="#qa" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q&amp;A</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Different questions have their own version of agile - Kris</li>
  <li>Kathleen: Perspective is agile: do short sprints, what can we do in one month, or three months</li>
  <li>Kris Hosted a git lab at Qualcomm,</li>
  <li>Kathleen, Data scientists had massive databases such as massive ultra locators, to predict where the demand for the Covid vaccine will be.
    <ul>
      <li>Tech analysts and data scientists rely on each other.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The most important skill to have in the tech industry is to embrace continuous learning.
    <ul>
      <li>Learn how to learn, training based on the company, be open to learning new infrastructures and doing things differently</li>
      <li>Don’t be concerned about things you hear on the news, find resilience</li>
      <li>The only risk you take from jointing a new company or startup is not learning</li>
      <li>Don’t be concerned about things not falling into place
  Tech is in high demand for very good workers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Kathyleen: be adaptive, it is a zigzaggy path
    <ul>
      <li>The best technical people to work with are listeners to requirements and are able to translate it into how the technology can solve those requirements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Biggest challenge in the tech industry, how they overcome it
    <ul>
      <li>Kathy: Qualcomm is a semiconductor industry and they went through many acquisitions. Serial acquirers, big fish in the sea. Had to adapt to all the new companies and teams joining</li>
      <li>Kris Interviews for jobs are a series of time random tests, and your code has to compile to their requirements, very hard to get the job. 
  Hours in a week</li>
      <li>Kris: companies are usually in a position to negotiate the hours they work.
        <ul>
          <li>Some people like the environment of coding for long periods of time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What happened at Twitter, Kris, First hand experience
    <ul>
      <li>Formal training of their systems. The programs that different companies build have to be taught to every new employee, every company does it differently.</li>
      <li>You need to be able to be effective in your job.</li>
      <li>Twitter has an open source network called fenagle that teaches you how to write a service.</li>
      <li>Also has a mono repo, all the backend of Twitter.
        <ul>
          <li>Must be able to navigate these thousands of lines of code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do you think learning to code will help in the business industry?
    <ul>
      <li>Learning how to code is a way of thinking, teaches you critical thinking, problem solving. Walk through how and why you reach the conclusion you did. Make good assumptions that eventually solve a problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#my-expirience-and-thoughts-on-the-pannel" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Expirience and Thoughts on the Pannel</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I thought the pannel was very interesting and it was very nice to hear the different perspectives on the STEM industry from two proffessionals.</li>
  <li>Kathyleens presentation on Qualcomms R&amp;D was very interesting to me and it was very cool to hear about how Qualcomm Semiconductors are very beneficial to the world with their 5g capabilities.
    <ul>
      <li>I also thought it was very cool how Kathyleen wanted to work at a place that actually impacted the world in some way.</li>
      <li>It was very beneficial for us to learn about how STEM is a ziggy zaggy path and we never know which ways its going to take us. We have to adapt to new things in this industry</li>
      <li>Also, she explained that the best people to work with are good listeners.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The presentation that Kris Porter gave us was very interesting, because we got to learn about someone who had numerous jobs throughout his career and how it developed his knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>It was inspiring to hear that he never liked or was good at computer science untill after college, and now he works in the industry professionally .
        <ul>
          <li>This relates to me, because I have never been the biggest Computer Science person, but he motivates me to continue developing my skills and knowledge of coding.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I would say that the most important thing I learned from this pannel was that learning how to code would be beneficial for all industries because it teaches you critical thinking skills and problem solving that aids you in any job you could have.
    <ul>
      <li>Additionally, Mr. Porter’s remarks on continuous learning were very important to know about so you will expect to learn from every job you have.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
