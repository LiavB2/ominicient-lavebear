<ul>
  <li>My group contains 5 members: Noor, Ederick, Steven, Nathan, and Myself.</li>
  <li>We are presenting Unit 3 lessons 1-2, and since those 2 lessons are split into 5 sections, each of us is responsible for presenting one of the sections
    <ul>
      <li>I recieved Unit 3 lesson 2 section 3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of us will develop our own presentation, follow along jupyter notebook, non-lecture stuff, and hacks/HW for our portion</p>
  </li>
  <li>The group will each make their lesson and hacks on individual markdown posts, then we will combine these into one master post that we will present to the class
    <ul>
      <li>We will also convert this master markdown into a Jupyter notebook that will include coding practice and debugging that our classmates will follow along with our lesson.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Since our topics (Variables, Assignments, and Data Abstraction) are quite short and simple, each group member will “lecture” for a very short amount of time before giving the class a task, because they most likely already know how to do our topic.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>My group members previously went over variables and how to make lists and strings, so it is my job to make examples.</li>
  <li>Mention and go over this reference sheet for making lists with values, aLists, and Blists:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>After this I will pause and ask the class to complete a python quiz that will be in the jupyter notebook.
    <ul>
      <li>Questions in this quiz would include:
        <ul>
          <li>The purpose of lists and dictionaries are to manage the _____ of a program (Complexity)</li>
          <li>Lists are a form of data <strong>__</strong> (abstraction)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Part of the Hacks will be screenshotting their answers to this quiz.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Explan how using a list is a good way to simplify a code segment
    <ul>
      <li>For example I just make a new line for each name like: Name1 = John (break) Name2 = Jake (break) …
        <ul>
          <li>A way to simplify this is Names = [John, Jake, …]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Here I will have a debug segment in the jupyter notebook:
    <ul>
      <li>A list will be displayed the “long and slow way” by typing out each individual variable (such as the one above with the names) then the class will be tasked to manage the complexity of this list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="on-a-markdown">
<a class="anchor" href="#on-a-markdown" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On a Markdown:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a screenshot of your score on the python quiz</li>
  <li>Insert a screenshot of your debuging of the list</li>
  <li>Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code?</li>
  <li>Make your own list the “long and slow way” then manage the complexity of the list</li>
</ul>
