## Display of the Change of Theme (Minima to Hacker)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/changetheme.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear") 

- After changing the theme of my Fastpages from Minima to Hacker, I noticed multiple changes to the design of the website. 
- First of all, the dark mode that I had was removed and became light mode again. 
- Next, I noticed that the indent for the links to each post was removed. They were all the way to the left.
- Finally, rather than having tabs to visit other pages on the website (located in the top right), there is a dropdown menu that has all the page options listed (located in the top left).


## Constraints of Changing Theme
 

- After changing the theme to hacker, I noticed that every code that I ran![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BashInHacker.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear") in "Bash Kernel" just became text (like a markdown).

## Search Feature

- Using the search page, you can see the ability to search for any key words that pop up throughout the fastpages website.
- This image displays a search for "Python" and it outputs links to every page/post/markdown/notebook on the website that contains python in it.

## Tagging

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tags.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- As you can see, the fastpages website has tags for any markdown post or Jupyter notebook, and any post that contains code blocks with Bash or Python Kernel.
- Under the 4 tags that are present you can see every post/markdown in the website that contains each of the tags (categories).
