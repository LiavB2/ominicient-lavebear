## Display of the Change of Theme (Minima to Hacker)

- After changing the theme of my Fastpages from Minima to Hacker, I noticed multiple changes to the design of the website. 
- First of all, the dark mode that I had was removed and became light mode again. 
- Next, I noticed that the indent for the links to each post was removed. They were all the way to the left.
- Finally, rather than having tabs to visit other pages on the website (located in the top right), there is a dropdown menu that has all the page options listed (located in the top left).


## Constraints of Changing Theme

- After changing the theme to hacker, I noticed that every code that I ran in "Bash Kernel" just became text (like a markdown).
