# Scrum Board
[Here is the link to our Scrum Board](https://github.com/users/LiavB2/projects/3)

# Frontend ideation: Here are a few ideas we have that can possibly meet the college board requirements
- We plan on making a convienient exercise tracker web-app. We will do this by implementing wearable integration, user personalization, goal setting, weather-based activity suggestions, meal planning, and exercise tracking.
    - user personalization: This will include exercise suggestions based on the users height, weight, BMI, age, and gender.
    - goal setting: This will include the user to prompt realistic goals for themselves in order to improve
    - Weather-based activity suggestions: This will be made through a weather api. For example, if the weather api sends the data back to the caller and the data says that today will be a rainy day, then the suggestion will be to do a home workout.
    - meal planning: based on the users personalized data. User will be categorized into bulk, cut, or maingain and will be given the meal suggestions based on this.
    - Exercise tracking: This will track the users exercise activity. It will have a database of a lot of exercises and their average calories burned/min, and other info.

# Agile Manifesto
- Here is our team manifesto:

1. Create a project that satisfies the teachers expectations and the developers
2. Have a product that goes above and beyond the project criteria and is beneficial to others
3. Don't worry about making mistakes! Mistakes are learning opportunities!
4. We will respect each others time and commitment and strive to be reliable and meet the deadlines on time
5. Support and encourage each others personal and professional growth

# How will we use SASS?
- Our main usage for SASS will be to modularize our code by making use of the import function in SASS
