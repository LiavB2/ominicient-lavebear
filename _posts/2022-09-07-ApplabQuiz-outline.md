- Answer choices to be images and not just words

# Pre-Coding Thoughts and Ideas

## What I am Confident in:
- Writing the question 
- displaying the answer choices
- Changing the background

## What I am not Confident that I can do (yet):
- Displaying if they got the question Incorrect or Correct
- Embeding an image as an answer choice

---

# Thoughts I Have While Coding
- How do I make an image a button as the answer choice? (EDIT) Name the image and use "onEvent" command to make "image name" on "click" set screen __.
- How can I display that the user got a question correct/incorrect? (EDIT) I originally wanted the "Correct" or "Incorrect" to show on the same page where the question was asked, but I resorted to changing to a "wrong" or "right" answer screen upon the click of a wrong or right answer.

# Post Coding Thoughts

## Successes
- Images as answer choices
- Making a nice background
- Quiz displays if the user got an answer right/wrong
- Intuitive/easy to use quiz
- Was able to include every question I wanted.

## Failures
- II originally wanted the "Correct" or "Incorrect" to show on the same page where the question was asked, but I was not able to figure out how to do this. 

## What I learned
- I became familiar with how to use the block coding, while learning the basics of Java.
