# Algorythmic Performance
- I was very excited to have the opportunity to miss class and come watch my friends in CSA do their performances.
- They were very fun, interesting, and a great learning experience.
- Here are the 3 groups I saw:

# Period 1 Groups:

## Macro Monkeys

- This group had a fascinating performance that had a lot of skipping and changing
- This was definately the most theatrical presentation of the 3 (you can tell because Mr. Yeung changed his grade 3 times)
- I thought their choreography was great, but I didint really understand the code.

## Select Sorters

- This group was probably my favorite, because of all the friends I had in the group.
- There wasnt much dancing and it wasnt really choreagraphed, but I understood the coding portion better than the last group
- It was kind of weird that their numbers were on the back not the front, but it was still good.

## Bubble Sort Bananza

- This group was extremely 50/50 because they were perfect in one aspect but terrible in another
- I understood the coding part the best out of the 3, as I was clearly able to make out what bubble sorting was and what the benefits of it are.
    - Sorts from least to greatest to be able to binary search a specific number
- However their presentation was terrible and boring. 

# Overall
- This was overall a very fun experience, I'm glad the CSA kids were able to have fun and make these presenations
- My favorite one was the Second group, but probably because I got to watch and make fun of my cousin, Re'em B.
