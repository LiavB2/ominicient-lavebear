# Notes

## Understanding Procedures
- A procedure is a set of instructions that is given a name which takes in parameters to return values
    - also called methods and functions
    - Sequencing, selection, and iteration are procedures
- Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result
    - Allows procredure to run without knowing the specific input values.

- As you an see, this procedure is named "multiply" its parameters are "x" and "y" and returns "The product of 5 times 3 is 15

## Calling Procedures 
- You call a procedure by putting the name of ot follwed by paranthesis with the parameters.
    - Ex: def math(x)

## Determining the result of a procedure
- Follow the code line by line to see what eaach line does
- Use syntax to determine
    - function parameters and retunr value and statements.
- to return the values you write "return" then the expression you want to return that has been defined.

- As you can see this code originally did not have return statement

- After debugging it with the return statement "return result" we can see the actual output of the function.

## Managing Complexity
- **Modularity** - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program
    - Ex: assert "hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5" 
        - They would have the same result.
- **Abstraction** - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use
- **Duplication** - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency
- **Logic** - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code

## Developing Procedures
- Parameters store variables and arguments
- Call functions with procedure names (syntax in javascript and python)

- Procedure name: the name that was given to a function
- Arguments provied info to a functio and are usually defined outside of the function then imported into a function with parameters.

### Python: 
```bash
def function(a,b): # function is defined
  print(a+b) # prints output of variables

function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used
function(2,3) # another instance
```

```
3
5
```

- defines the function with the parameters then prints their sum
    - 1 + 2 is 3
    - 2 + 3 is 5
### JavaScript:

```javascript
function Function(a,b) {
  return a + b;
}

Function(1,2)
Function(2,3)
```

```
3
5
```

- Calls the function with the parameters then adds them together
    - 1 + 2 is 3
    - 2 + 3 is 5

## More Parameters
- someetimes parameters will provide input to the function

- This function provides 2 parameters and uses them as inputes and calling the function compares the 2 numbers.

# Hacks

## 3.12

### Procedure and Parameter
- Procedure: In an algorithm, it completes a certain task
    - must be called to function 
    - Will take in parameters and will output values.
- Parameters: Variables that are usually used within procedures.


### Quiz (3/3)

### Return Values and Output Parameters
- Return Values: The result of the procedure once it is run
- Output Parameters: variables that are used within procedures that can lead to a certain output.

### Code a square root procedure

## 3.13

### Why is abstracting program logic into seperate modular functions effective?
- 

### Procedure that uses other sub-procedures + explaination

### Add another layer of abstraction to the word counter

### Procedure Names and Arguments
- 

### Code of Procedures, Arguments, and Parameters (interactive with HTML and JavaScript)
