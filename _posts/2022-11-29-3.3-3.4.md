# Notes 

## 3.3

### an Algorithm is a set of instruction that accomplish a task

#### Sequencing 
- The order of how you do something 
- Like the instructions of a teacher and howo you follow them

#### Selection 
- Allows the algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met
    - Go to the gas station if your tank is empty, dont if its full.

#### Iteration 
- A loop that does something over and over again until a condition is met

### Mathematical Expressions
- Sequential statements specify how signals are assigned and the process that is executed as a whole. 
    - Execute in the order in which they appear

#### Examples of arithmetic operators:
-Addition: a+b
-Subtraction: a-b
-Multiplication: a*b
-Division: a/b
-Modulus: a MOD b
(a and b can be string or number)

#### Modulus operator divides the given numeratior by the denominatior to find the result.
- The syntax is %.

## Strings
- String concatenation joins two or more strings end to end to make a new string

### Examples of strings in pseudocode:
- len (str)
    - returns the number of character is str
    - len("hello") returns 5

- concat (str1, str2)
    - returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str 2
    - concat("hello","world") return 'hello world'

- substring (str1, str2, length)
    - returns a substring of consecutive character from str1, starting the character at position 'start' and containing 'length' character
    - substring ("hello","world", 4,5) returns 'lo wor'


# Hacks

## Hack #1

### Sequencing 
- The order of how you do something 
- Like the instructions of a teacher and howo you follow them
- It was 1-5 on the image

### Selection 
- Allows the algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met
    - Go to the gas station if your tank is empty, dont if its full.
- It was #3 on the image

### Iteration 
- A loop that does something over and over again until a condition is met
- Was #4 on the image

## Hack #2

### Crossword Puzzle
- 1 down: Iteration
- 2 down: Selection
- 3 accross: Sequence
