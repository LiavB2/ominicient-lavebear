# Mistakes

## Question: 11

- I originally thought that using this smart home device could reveal the users passwords but now that I think about it, it makes no sense because you are not telling the smart home device any passwords. It only makes sense that phishing in this scenario would be if an email is sent to user from supposedly the company. I dont know how the scammer would know that they purchased the smart home, but this seems to be the most relevent phishing opportunity.

## Question: 19

- When looking at this FOR loop it looked to me as if all the elemints in list1 then list 2 are contents of the result because the if statemt for List2 is located within the IN List1 code segment, but this is also because I did not know what append means. In reality, the output would be only emlements in both List1 and List2 because List1 is originally empty, due to the IF isfound. Not a silly mistake, I was just a bit confused on what this code meant.

## Question: 29

- When looking at this code segment I thought the output would be true true ture, but I could not have been more wrong. I completely misunderstood the code, and now see that it was actually false false false because A and C were orignallay assigned false with statements 4 and 5, an B does not change after its orignally assigned false. This was a very silly mistake, I don't think I was paying attention to the detail in the moment.

## Question: 50

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/final50.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- For this probelm I simply misclicked C and immediately went and pressed the submit button. This was as silly of a mistake as it gets. This was a very simple problem and I knew the correct answers but I just misclicked. It is very obvious to see that Algorithm C does not run efficiently (along with B) while A and D run linearly and exponentially which is very efficient in comparisson to the list size.

# Reflection
- Overall I think I did very well on this MC once again and I am definately getting better at answering the questions about actual code. My 4 mistakes were relatively silly, except question 19 when I did not know what "append" meant. My mistakes will be resolved once I go deeper into the college board content.
