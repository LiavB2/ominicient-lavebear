## 5.3 Hacks
-  Facebook vs TikTok: 
    - Both Facebook and TikTok have faced criticism for their algorithmic biases and for excluding certain content or demographics. Whether this exclusion is purposeful or not is a matter of debate. However, it is generally considered harmful as it can lead to unequal representation and opportunities for certain groups. The correction of algorithmic biases is important for promoting fairness and inclusion. Whether it is good business or not depends on the company's priorities and values.
- Amazon, Alexa, Google, Apple Siri: 
    - The difficulty in detecting accents or young voices in these virtual assistants has been widely reported and has led to criticism of the companies. This could be due to a variety of factors, including the limited diversity of the data used to train the systems or a lack of attention to the issue. This can be harmful as it can limit access to these technologies for certain groups. It is important for these companies to correct these flaws and ensure that their systems are accessible to everyone. Whether this is good business or not depends on the company's priorities and values.
- Netflix:
    -  There have been allegations that Netflix's algorithm biases certain content to certain viewers. The purpose of this is to improve the viewing experience for each user. However, this can also result in unequal representation and opportunities for certain content creators. Whether this is harmful or good business is a matter of debate, but it is important for companies to be transparent about their algorithmic processes and ensure that they are fair and inclusive.

- HP Racism video questions
    - The situation is that the face tracking capability of the HP computer webcam works perfectly on a white woman but malfunctions and does not work with black people.
    - The owner definately does not believe that this malfunction was intentional, you can tell because he clearly jokes around about it being racist.
    - I think this occured due to the failure to use black subjects when testing this technology. 
    - I do not believe that this is harmful in any way, because there were no intentions to be racist. HP obviously simply made the mistake of not using colored subjects when testing their facial tracking.
    - This issue should most definately be corrected, and it probably has since this video is from 2009.
    - I think you should have a diverse range of test subjects when creating a technology based on the outside looks of an individual. If we do this everytime without fail, we will never have an issue like this again.

## 5.4 Hacks
- To initiate crowd-sourcing for a class of 150 computer science students we can
    - Divide the class into groups: Depending on the size of the task, divide the class into smaller groups of 4-5 students each and define the problem or task: Clearly state the problem or task you want the students to solve or contribute to
    - We can also Set up a platform and Choose an appropriate platform, such as GitHub, Google Drive or a project management tool, for the students to collaborate and submit their work, furthermore we will Assign each student a specific role such as a project manager, researcher, developer, or designer.
    - Provide guidelines: Provide clear guidelines and instructions for the students on how to collaborate, communicate, and submit their work
    - Regularly monitoring the progress of the students and provide feedback and guidance where necessary. Another important task we can do is evaluate the submissions based on the guidelines and criteria provided, and provide feedback to the students.
    
- Crowd-Sourcing for our fitness program. To implement crowd sourcing in a fitness tracking web app we can:
    - Encourage user engagement: Provide incentives for users to share their fitness data, such as challenges, rewards, or recognition on a leaderboard.
    - Collect and store user data by Creating a database or use an API to collect and store user-generated fitness data, such as workout routines, progress, and other metrics.
    - Implement data sharing features: Allow users to share their fitness data with others, either through social media integration, direct sharing with friends, or by making it public to all users.
    - Analyze the crowd-sourced data to provide insights, generate personalized recommendations, or create a community-wide analysis of trends and patterns.
    - Foster a community by encouraging users to engage with one another and provide resources such as forums, discussion boards, or messaging systems to facilitate collaboration and support.
