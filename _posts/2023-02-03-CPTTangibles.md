# My Tangible Addition - Stats Tracker

- You can see that the front end is not looking too nice right now, this is because our front end team is working on a better theme that would work for every feature.

## Key additions and fixes
- This week I made a lot of progress and made some key additions and fixes. 
    - First: I added a "records table" with just one row. The data in each cell gets edited based on the corresponding new record or "max" that the user inputs using the button under each stat. This is meant to be an easy way to remember and track your records in everything.
    - Then I changed the table that was there before and made it the "chart" where you can log all the progress you have made. I made the input for that table under the "date" section now
    - Finally: I was finally able to make the "remove entry" feature functionable, as the user can now delete any entry they want.

## Goals
- I would definately like the front end to look nice
- I still need to figure out how to save user data to a database rather than it being local storage.
- Make the age algorithm that I planned earlier work.

## Connection between frontend and backend
- My database has data in the backend, and my plan is for this data to be able to be posted on my frontend MAX or Records table, based on the user input. I need to figure out how to take the user input on the front end and add it to my table.
