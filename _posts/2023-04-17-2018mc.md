# Mistakes

## Question: 6

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018q6.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- I had no idea what IETF was so I through out a random guess. Apparently Internet Engineeiring Task Force develppes the standards for internet communication.

## Question: 13

- I just made a simple wording mistake. The data clearly showed that there were less users on the site after the app was released, but I interpreted this as new users on the site

## Question: 45

- This was just a really silly mistake, the whole point of procedral extraction is to redice the amount of the same code with different numbers or variables, I probably just sped through this problem. 

## Question: 66

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018q66.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- Since the function returns the first value in the list that is less than the first value, both C and D would output a number that abides to that, however they would not be the lowest number in the list.

# Reflection
- Overall I think I did very well on this MC once again and I am definately getting better at answering the questions about actual code. My 4 mistakes were relatively silly, and I was probably just fazed because of how long the test was.
