# Video Notes:

## Video 1: 
- All programs are developed for a purpose: to solve problems or pursue interest.
- Categories of innovations include Applications (games/Social media), Systems (email), and Physical Devices (computers, phones).
- Keep in mind the guiding questions:
   - Why does the computing innovation exist?
   - What problems does the computing innovation solve?
   - What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not before?
- understanding the purpose of a program is essential to improve the programmers ability to improve the function.

## Video 2:
- Program inputs are a date setnt to compiters for processing by the program
- events are associated with an action and supplies input data to a program
- Events are generated by a defined action
- Programm statmetns are executed when triggered
- Program output is data sent from a programs input to a device in the form of visual/text/audio

## Video 3:
- program is a collection of statements that perform a task when run (known as a software)
- A Code segment is a collection of code statements, according to the rules of a programming language
    - To describe it: Simply state what the segment does, so someone else can use it without reading the whole thing
    - explain in detail how it functions.
- A program must work for a variety of inputs and situations.
- The Behavior of a program is how a program functions during its excecution (how a user interacts with it)
- Programs are described by what the program does and how its statements accomplish the function.

## Problem I Got Incorrect:
- In problem #2 it displayed a code and the problem asked us to explain its purpose. I understood that it would display true if x is negative, but I assumed that it would display false if anything otherwise, however there isn no documentation of the code saying it would do that. Therefore, it would display nothing otherwise, not false.

# Hacks Qs:

1. We have a good idea for the PBL web final project. We are going to make a daily planner for your events, homework, and schedule. 

2. This function has an educational purpose, because it will be made to balance your life better.

3. Since we can add various features to a daily planner such as a mood tracker and reminder feature, this will definately allow us to work for 8 weeks.

4. This project will certainly be usefull past the 8 weeks, because it will allow you to plan your events forever.

5. This project would certainly be viable for the create a performance task, as it has many functions that would meet most of the requirements.
