# Notes

## Unsolvable vs undecidable 
- Unsolvable: is that no algorithm can be written to get the answer to it
- Undecidable: There is no code that can find the answer, because it is too complext, but there is an answer.

## Undecidability Example

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/yasha1.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear") 

 - We do not know if there is a number that will solve this pattern.
    - There is an infinite amount of inputs, and we don't know which one will run the code infinitely.

## Vocab

### Collatz Conjecture
- one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. 
    - it asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.

### Hailstone numbers
- The sequence of integers generated by Collatz conjecture
    - Examples: Input : N = 7 Output : Hailstone Numbers: 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 No.
    - Code terminates at 1.

### Undecidable problems 
- A Problem that should give a "yes" or "no" answer, but yet no algorithm exists that can answer correctly on all inputs.

### Iteration
- The action or a process of iterating or repeating:
    -  such as. : a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result.

## Algorithm Efficiency
- Inefficient algorthims are slower and could sometimes take more processing and computing power to run

# Hacks

## Combine Hailstone and Number of Iterations

## Write one algorithm that is efficient and one that is inefficient. Compare them and explain why one is and why one isn't efficient.

## How one algorithm can be more efficient than annother using mathematical and formal reasoning


## Use variables, if statements, and loops to program an algorithm
