# Managing Complexity with lists - Liav 

## Long and slow way
- By now, everyone should know the "long and slow way" to print a list of something in python
    - It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable
    - This method is displayed in this example with test scores:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/LASW.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as "score1 = 95" and then you just print each variable.
- However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient...

## Assinging values to one variable
- Use square brackets "[]" to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/scorevar.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print.

## How lists manage complexity of a program
- Simplification
    - It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way
    - Makes the code segment much easier to read

- Variables
    - You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable
    - To change a value you don't have to edit/add/remove an entire variable

## Python Quiz
- Now everyone should take this short python quiz and screenshot your score.

## Simplify Foods List 
- Now simplify this foods list using what you have learned

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Lfoodlist.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

## Hacks
- On a single markdown file:
    - Insert a screenshot of your score on the python quiz
    - Insert a screenshot of your simplifying of the food list
    - Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code?
    - Make your own list the "long and slow way" then manage the complexity of the list

## Rubric
- In ordere to earn a .20/.20 you must
    - On a markdown post:
    - make an attempt at the python quiz
    - Successfully simplify the food list
    - Answer the question in detail
    - Provide evidence of your own list that you coded
