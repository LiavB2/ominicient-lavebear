# Sociology Hacks Questions 
- The main repository for out project is "lash-journal", because our project is a journal and our names are Liav, Annkika, Sophia, Haeryn.
- We have too little files to have a gitignore, but eventually when we have many, we will create one. 
- We do create issues every week to document what we have done that week.
- Everytime a group member does work we create pull requests so everyone can pull the changes.
- We have a scrum master that created a scrum board with the started, completed, want to do, etc.
- We have created a couple issues on our Scrumboard, which you can see it [here.](https://github.com/users/haeryny/projects/1/views/1). We have completed many tasks and are looking to do some more now so we will start coding next week probably.
