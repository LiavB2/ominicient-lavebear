# Notes

3.8 

## Iteration
- Iteration is a repeating part of an algorithm that repeats a specfied number of times until a condition is met
- Iteration statemtns change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met

### Example:
- Trying to find a lost item
    - Determine what the item is
    - Ask every family member/friend who would see it
         - Stop condition: If you find it go to step 5
    - make a full sweep of everywhere you have 
        - Stop Condition: If you find it go to step 5
    - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the item is found
    - If never find it: Go Back to your room and cry
    - If you find item: enjoy the item

- Example in code

## Result of Iteration Statements 
- When using a range function, the last number in the input is not included in the output.
    - Starting value: The number that the range function will start with
    - Incrementing: The number in which the range increments by
    - Ending value: The final number of the range.

## Loops 
- While loops use a condition then print something based on a condition.
    - This example prints all even numbers less than 10.

- the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. 
- Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. 

3.10

## Lists 
- the process of visiting each element in a list in a sequential order.
    - Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed - Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed
    - Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time.
- Traversing allows you to access or search for certain elements

### College Board Lists
- insert( ) allows a value to be inserted into a list at index i
- append( ) allows a value to be added at the end of a list 
- remove( ) allows an element at index i to be deleted from a list
- length( ) returns the number of elements currently in a specific list

### Here is an example question

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/listmc.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- The answers would be B and D, because they value the responsies rather than the animals

- The loop above allows the coder to access each item within the list


# Hacks


## Iteration 
1. Define an Iteration
2. Make your own example of an iteration with at least 4 steps and a stopping condition(Similar to mine that I did)
3. Program a simple iteration.

## Iteration Statements
1. What is an iteration statement, in your own words?
2. Create a descending list of numbers using for loop
3. Using while loop, make a list of numbers which will form an output of 3,16,29,42,55,68,81

## Find the Lowest Value
