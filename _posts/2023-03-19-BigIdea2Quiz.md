# Mistakes

## Question: 21

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bi22.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- This problem showed us a spreadheet of infor about photos in a colection containing photographer, subject, year, and available variables. The question then asks which sequences could be used to dentify a desired entry after applying the above filters. I think I just made a silly mistake, buecause I knw it was sort by year, filter, photographer by looking at the table , but I then thought it was sirt by subject, year, and filter by photograoher as well, but it turns out that that would have an output of -1. THe correct answers overall would be B and D.

# Reflection
- I'm getting better at these quizzes, and at this point I have just been getting tired/bored while taking the tests so I make silly mistakes. Overall, this quiz gave a nice review of the Big Idea 2 topics that we went over in class.
