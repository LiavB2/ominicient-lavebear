### Chat GPT

- An Artificial intelligence tool that gives you the answer to any question you ask it.
    - Microsoft originally invested $1B and is thinking of adding another $10B because they believe that it is their only hope against google
        - They believe it to be the google killer
        - Its google without the source or the extra clicking to find the answer
- Good:
    - Getting one definite answer right away
    - Gives you quality answers based on the entire internet
- Bad:
    - You don't get multiple points of view on the question you ask it.
        - Computer Bias, who ever programs it programs their own bias towards every answer
        - Does not cite every community
    - Does not give you the sources 
    - Lesson: something you have to think about when being a computer engineer is if you are inserting your own bias in your program.

### Technology
- Tech that was made and should be getting updated over time
    - Automated phone answering systems 

### Video Games
- Could be good or bad as well


## Big Idea 5.2: Digital Divide
- The divide in our world between people who have access to technology and those who do not.

### Privallege
- We are privalleged to have the tech we have
- Google employees have super computers, we don't
    - School wifi blocks some things, but Google wifi does not
    - Algorithmic geniusses who have more data than us
    - Google is ahead of us on the digital divide, but we are way ahead of Hoover High School (Southern SD school in a less fortunate area)



# Hacks

## 5.1 Questions to think about
- Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

## 5.2 Questions to think about
- How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

## Canvas Questions
- Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit
    - Motivation and accountability: Our Etracker can help users set goals and track their progress, which can provide motivation to stick to a fitness routine and hold them accountable for their actions.
    - Data analysis and insights: Etracker can collect and analyze data on the user's fitness activity, such as weight, bench press, squat, etc. This can provide valuable insights into the user's fitness level and help them identify areas where they can improve.
    - Also gives users the ability to track and monitor various health metrics, such as heart rate, sleep, and calorie intake.It can be a tool to measure and track progress and make adjustments in their workout plan.

- Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.
    - Creating a negative body image and promoting disordered eating habits by constantly monitoring and comparing one's own physical activity and progress to others
    - Causing individuals to become too focused on achieving certain fitness goals, leading to burnout or injury
    - Potentially exposing sensitive personal information, such as the weight of a user that us (the programmers) would be able to see.

- Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
    - Pros of having an internet blocker at school are that it can prevent access to potentially harmful or distracting websites, such as those containing violent or pornographic content, during certain hours or at all times, reduce distractions and increase productivity for students and staff, even possibly prevent cyberbullying and other online harassment
    - Cons of using internet blockers at school could be that it can limit access to educational resources and tools, such as online research databases or video conferencing platforms, restrict students' and staff's freedom of speech and expression, and can make it more difficult to troubleshoot or repair the machines if issues arise since programs that help fix them could be blocked.

- What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.
- In our society, I am very concerned about the limited access to education and job opportunities for those without access to technology. Additionally, Inability for those without technology to participate fully in society and access.
- Also, important services such as healthcare and government benefits are very hard to achieve without technology. With more technology being created everyday, there is a potential for further marginalization of already disadvantaged communities because they are getting more and more disadvantage everytime a privalleged person gets some.
- In my personal experience, I have next to no digital divide as I have all the technology I need in order to succeed in modern society.
