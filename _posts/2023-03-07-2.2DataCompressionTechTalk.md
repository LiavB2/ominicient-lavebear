# 2.2 Data Compression Notes

- We shrink files in order to save speed and storage.
    - Reduction of bits saves storage and saves transmision time
- Lossy data reduces data but the original is not recovered
- Lossless data lets you restore and recover
- Often when we work with files we use c: and cd to take us towards a certain directory

## Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook
> Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories

### IPython 
> Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks.  Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML.

### pathlib
> File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux.  This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS's), pathlib is a solution to this problem. 
- What are commands you use in terminal to access files?
- What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files?
- What are some of the major differences?

- Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.
- Why is path a big deal when working with images?
- How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics?
- Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?

### Data Structures and OOP
- When we are now working on this data and images unit
- Base 64 converts binary encoded data into an encoded scheme of 24 bits and 6 base64 bits. 
    - It is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS
    - First 3 letters of my name in Base64: TGlh
- Numpy is an artificial intelligence data science tool
    - Mort uses them to manipulate and grab images
