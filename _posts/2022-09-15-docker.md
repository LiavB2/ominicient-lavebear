# Fastpages Local Server with Docker
- As you can see I have successfully created a local server for my fastpages website that allows me to create a preview of potential edits and changes to the site. After I review my changes on the local server, I can then commit them to my actual website.

- You can see that the server address was created:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/fastpageslocalserveraddress.png "https://github.com/LiavB2/ominicient-lavebear")

- That leads to this server:

# Python Webpages Local Server
