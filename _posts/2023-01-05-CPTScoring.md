|Reporting Category|My Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|-|-|-|-|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|No, does not explain the functionality of the program.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1| Explains the list of data and the list being used and meets all the requirements.|
|Managing Complexity|1|0|Manages the complexity of the program with a code segment and explains it. EDIT AFTER: did not explain how it manages the complexity of the program, just what it does.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1| Has two code segments with a parameter and calls a procedure with good explaination|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1| Has good code segments with algorithms with sequencing, iteration, and selection with great detail in the explanation.|
|Testing|1|1|Tests their two different calls with the results of each and nicely explains the conditions of each call and how they were found, with their result.|

## My Score: 5/6
## College Board Score: 4/6

### Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard?
- My grading was very similar to college board, for the most part, however for Managing complexity, I did not see that their list was not essential for their program to function, which is why I gave them an undeserved point. Return statements and strings would give them the same result as making it into a list, so there is really no functionality of it.

### Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard
- For managing complexity, Return statements and strings would give them the same result as making it into a list, so there is really no functionality of it, meaning that they would not meet the standard
- For Program purpose, they do not expain the problem that is being solved from their program.

|-|-|-|-|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|1| Explains in great detail the purpose and functionality of their program along with the inputs and outputs.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|Clearly shows two program segments that stores data in a list and its purpose, and names them.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1|Uses a very functional list with multiple stored elements, along with a great explaination.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1| Has two code segments with parameters that are called along with a great explanation of the functionality of the procedure.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1| Includes a very nice algorithm with sequencing, iteration, and selection along with a very detailed explanation.|
|Testing|1|1|Provides the two calls with their tested conditions, along with their results that are different.|

## My Score: 6/6
## College Board Score: 6/6

### Discrepencies between my scoring and Collegeboard?
- This one was much easier to grade, because it was a clear 6/6. They were spot on for every requirement and explained/coded everything in absolute detail, so it checked all the boxes.
- I will save this for reference in the future, however I understand that Mr. Mort expects more from us than that.

### Criteria and why a submision may have failed to meet the standard
- No failures, this one was great.


# Reflection: 

## What my program will need to fill the requirements?
- Fulfilling all the college board requirements seems easy enough, since Mr. Mort has held us to an extremely high standard this whole school year, so I ddefinately understand all the requirements of this project and how I can exceed them even further.


## How this will help me meet the college board requirements on my own project
- Completing this assignment gave me a very good runthrough of how the performance task should look like, and I will definitely come back to this post for reference in the near furure when I am working on my own create performance task.
