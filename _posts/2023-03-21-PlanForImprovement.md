# Overview
- My feature from the TRI 2 PBL project is the STATS feature on ETRACKER As I display above:
    - It is a feature that tracks the max stats of a user.
    - It has a full stack which connects a front end fastpages site and backend flask site. 
- This already meets the collegeboard requirements for a 6/6 CPT project
    - Here is the [Writeup](https://liavb2.github.io/ominicient-lavebear/cpt/2023/02/23/CPTWriteup.html) that displays this and has a video of it working.

## Issue I will fix: Plagiarism
- Though my project meets all the requirements, the issue I have is that my project contains a lot of code that is not mine, so I need to clean it up so that I only submit my code.

# Steps to finalizing the submission

## Redeploy the Flask
- Since we could not keep the group flask running forever, I will either need to make my own new flask and deploy it like we did last tri or use an existing one. 
- This flask will be where my backend code is stored and fetched.

## Personalize Frontend
-  First I will need to update my project so that none of the frontend is similar to others. This will include:
    - Personalizing menus/removing it entirely
    - Changing the color scheme so that my SASS and CSS code will not match someone elses or another github theme
    
## Apply Credit
- I will need to update my README.md so that I give credit to Mr. Mort and the nighthawkcodingsociety so that I am not flagged for violating the licensing policies that mort instated. 
- I will probably end up making a new readme.md from scratch

## Wipe Unceccesary Code
- Finally, I will have to remove all the files and code that do not contribute to my feature and my feature alone
- I will keep essential files such as the main.py, model, api, README and fetch codes
- Besides those I will have to completely wipe everything else so that the whole project is strictly mine.
