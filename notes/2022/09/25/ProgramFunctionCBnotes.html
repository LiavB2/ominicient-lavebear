  <li>All programs are developed for a purpose: to solve problems or pursue interest.</li>
  <li>Categories of innovations include Applications (games/Social media), Systems (email), and Physical Devices (computers, phones).</li>
  <li>Keep in mind the guiding questions:
    <ul>
      <li>Why does the computing innovation exist?</li>
      <li>What problems does the computing innovation solve?</li>
      <li>What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not before?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>understanding the purpose of a program is essential to improve the programmers ability to improve the function.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Program inputs are a date setnt to compiters for processing by the program</li>
  <li>events are associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
  <li>Events are generated by a defined action</li>
  <li>Programm statmetns are executed when triggered</li>
  <li>Program output is data sent from a programs input to a device in the form of visual/text/audio</li>

<ul>
  <li>program is a collection of statements that perform a task when run (known as a software)</li>
  <li>A Code segment is a collection of code statements, according to the rules of a programming language
    <ul>
      <li>To describe it: Simply state what the segment does, so someone else can use it without reading the whole thing</li>
      <li>explain in detail how it functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A program must work for a variety of inputs and situations.</li>
  <li>The Behavior of a program is how a program functions during its excecution (how a user interacts with it)</li>
  <li>Programs are described by what the program does and how its statements accomplish the function.</li>

<ul>
  <li>In problem #2 it displayed a code and the problem asked us to explain its purpose. I understood that it would display true if x is negative, but I assumed that it would display false if anything otherwise, however there isn no documentation of the code saying it would do that. Therefore, it would display nothing otherwise, not false.</li>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We have a good idea for the PBL web final project. We are going to make a daily planner for your events, homework, and schedule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This function has an educational purpose, because it will be made to balance your life better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we can add various features to a daily planner such as a mood tracker and reminder feature, this will definately allow us to work for 8 weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This project will certainly be usefull past the 8 weeks, because it will allow you to plan your events forever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This project would certainly be viable for the create a performance task, as it has many functions that would meet most of the requirements.</p>
  </li>
